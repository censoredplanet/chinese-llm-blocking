Foreign traders, primarily British, had been illegally exporting opium mainly from India into Chinese ports against Chinese laws1. This smuggling of opium was a significant issue because it created a trade imbalance; Britain bought too much tea from China, and to balance their trade, they resorted to the opium trade6. Additionally, specific incidents like the boarding of the British-registered ship Arrow by Canton police, where the crew was charged with smuggling, also contributed to the outbreak of hostilities9. The conflict eventually escalated into the First Opium War, fought between China and Britain from 1839 to 18428.",
