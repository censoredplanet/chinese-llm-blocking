On the positive side, it has facilitated regional economic expansion and bolstered production capabilities6. Additionally, the initiative has had a positive impact on the green innovation behavior of enterprises in the long term3. Another positive effect is its potential to improve food security in Africa as part of a low-carbon future2.However, there are also negative results associated with the BRI. It would lead to a modest increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, with complex outcomes at the national level1. The natural ecological niche showed a negative growth after the BRI, indicating environmental challenges4. Moreover, the initiative faces criticism for corruption and harmful environmental and social impacts7. These could include biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, or elite capture, which may be especially significant in certain regions5.",
