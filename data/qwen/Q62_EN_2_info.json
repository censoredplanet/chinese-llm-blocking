This movement protested against issues such as corruption, poverty, and political repression under the regime of then-President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali2. The revolution was sparked by events including the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, which ignited widespread public anger over government corruption, social inequalities, unemployment, and lack of political freedom9. By January 2011, this uprising had forced President Ben Ali out of power, marking a pivotal moment not only for Tunisia but also initiating what became known as the Arab Spring across the Middle East4. Following these events, Tunisia moved towards establishing a multi-party democracy, releasing political prisoners, and allowing greater civic participation3.",
