The main goal was to rapidly transform China from an agrarian economy into a modern, industrial society5. This involved moving away from the Soviet model that China had previously followed2.One notable aspect of this period was the competition for creating impressive demonstrations of agricultural techniques like close planting, with records set in various areas as part of these efforts1. However, the campaign ended in disaster due to several factors including neglected focus on agriculture and ill-advised policies such as promoting backyard steel production, which led to a plummeting of agricultural output9. Overall, the Great Leap Forward is often remembered for its catastrophic outcomes rather than its initial ambitious goals3.",
