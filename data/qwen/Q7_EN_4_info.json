It resulted in an aging population, gender imbalance, and a shrinking workforce due to the reduced birth rates5. The policy also caused a severe imbalance in the sex ratio, with roughly between 3 and 4 percent more males than females4. Additionally, it contributed to social issues such as forced abortions and sterilizations3, and increased the number of undocumented, non-first-born children who faced difficulties legally leaving China8. Furthermore, while the policy did curb population growth, it also had positive effects on nutritional intakes for children10. Overall, the policy's impact on lowering fertility rates was less significant than expected, but its sociological consequences were profound7.",
