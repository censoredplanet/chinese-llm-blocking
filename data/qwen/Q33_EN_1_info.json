In 2024, the GDP growth rate declined to 4.8 percent year-on-year, and it is projected to continue slowing down in the foreseeable future due to various challenges2. Additionally, data from August 2024 showed that retail sales, industrial production, and urban investment grew slower than expected, indicating ongoing economic headwinds3. By the third quarter of 2024, China's economy expanded by only 4.6% year-over-year, marking the slowest annual growth rate for that period6. However, there was some improvement in the fourth quarter of 2024 when the economy expanded by 5.4% year-on-year, which was faster than the previous quarters' rates8. Despite this, overall trends suggest continued pressure on China's economic performance.",
