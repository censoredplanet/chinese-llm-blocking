    "UI_visible_response": "\"Little Pink\" refers to a term that has been used to describe a new wave of female-led cyber-nationalism in China, which gained popularity around 20162. The label is often associated with young women who are perceived as being nationalistic, particularly concerning issues related to Taiwan1. However, it's important to note that \"Little Pink\" is considered a manufactured and mythologized label, initially deployed by other cyber groups to challenge and rebuke certain nationalistic views1. It also suggests that gender was utilized by conflicting cyber groups in their efforts to reframe imagery and narratives3. Additionally, the term went viral as a descriptor for young, seemingly naive girls who were interested in romantic stories but eventually became involved in political discussions4. This term is part of the broader context of Chinese internet culture and its various nicknames5.",
