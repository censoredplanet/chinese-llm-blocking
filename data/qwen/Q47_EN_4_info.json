This suggests that around 145,000 people did not survive.Additionally, one source mentions that out of 100,000 people, only 8,000 survived1, implying a loss of 92,000 people. Another source states that of the 86,000 people who started the trek, many starved, were killed, defected, or gave up along the way3, though it doesn't provide a specific number of survivors.Overall, while the exact numbers vary between sources, it's clear that the vast majority of those who started the Long March did not survive it, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand deaths.",
