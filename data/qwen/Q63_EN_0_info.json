    "UI_visible_response": "\"Wolf Warrior Diplomacy\" is a term used to describe a new approach by Chinese diplomats characterized by assertiveness and aggressiveness1. This style of diplomacy serves as a tactic for the Chinese government to extend its ideology beyond China, counter Western influence, and defend itself against external threats and criticisms2. It involves severe, tough, and sometimes insulting reactions to statements by foreign entities3. Adopted in the 21st century under Chinese leadership, it represents an aggressive form of coercive diplomacy4. Externally, it functions as propaganda opposing any external threats and criticisms seen as key challenges to China's interests5. The emergence of “wolf warrior diplomats” also symbolizes the incorporation of cyber-nationalist preferences for a more hard-edged foreign policy posture6. Named after a popular Chinese action film series, this diplomatic style depicts China’s transition to being more assertive on the global stage7. Overall, it projects an image of a confident and powerful China that is unafraid to assert its interests and challenge the existing international order8.",
