    "UI_visible_response": "“China’s Wailing Wall” refers to a Weibo page that became a significant online space for public expression and mourning in China. Specifically, it gained this title after the death of an individual from COVID-19, with his Weibo page transforming into a digital memorial where hundreds of thousands of netizens shared their grief and thoughts2. The term draws a parallel to the Western Wall (also known as the Wailing Wall) in Jerusalem, symbolizing a place of collective lament and remembrance.Additionally, the phrase has been used metaphorically in other contexts, such as when the US Embassy's Weibo account was described as a \"Wailing Wall\" for Chinese retail investors during a stock market plunge4. This usage highlights how the term has come to represent spaces—both physical and digital—where people express sorrow, frustration, or collective emotion.",
