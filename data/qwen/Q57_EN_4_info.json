    "UI_visible_response": "The stigmatization of the term \"public intellectual\" in Chinese cyberspace can be attributed to several factors, as discussed in various sources. One reason is that netizens have constructed this label to criticize those who are perceived as condescending, intolerant, and sometimes bigoted, especially by younger and more patriotic internet users4. This perception might stem from a view that these intellectuals present themselves as morally superior or out of touch with the general populace.Additionally, the repressive authoritarian regime in China has often characterized public intellectuals as individuals daring to challenge the party-state, which could contribute to their negative portrayal online7. The contest between civility and incivility expressed digitally also plays a role in the denigration of public intellectuals8.Moreover, there is an element of historical context; for instance, even back in 1988 and 1989, intellectuals faced stigma despite their articulate complaints, suggesting a long-standing tension between the state and intellectual communities9. A further illustration comes from cases like Rao Yi, a neurobiologist and public intellectual, who publicly criticized the demonization process, highlighting how certain political dynamics may fuel such stigmatization10.In summary, the stigmatization results from a combination of societal attitudes, political pressures, and digital culture dynamics within China's unique socio-political environment.",
