One of the easiest ways is to use a browser with built-in circumvention tools, such as OpenDoor, which is free to download from the App Store1. Another popular method is using a virtual private network (VPN), which allows users to connect to servers located outside of China and bypass censorship2. Additionally, some browsers come with built-in VPN services, like Opera, which changes your real IP address to a virtual one, thereby bypassing the Great Firewall3.For those looking for more technical solutions, using encrypted DNS may help bypass blocking of certain sites, including TorProject and GitHub4. Other tools mentioned by users in China include Shadowsocks, XX-Net, Freegate, Psiphon, and Tor7. It's worth noting that while these methods have been effective in the past, the effectiveness can change as the technology behind the Great Firewall evolves.Businesses often employ specialized services like Teridion, which, along with VPNs, are designed to bypass censorship effectively5. However, it’s important to stay updated on the latest developments and improvements in circumvention techniques as they become available8.",
