These centers focus on combining course learning with practical training to enhance the operational skills of individuals, which is seen as an important channel to boost their employment prospects [[3]]. The concept behind VSETCs represents a significant innovation over prior labor reform efforts, although it should be noted that these centers have also been subject to controversy and sanctions [[1]]. The training provided in these centers is intended to equip learners with essential skills for personal development and better job opportunities [[5]].

It's worth noting that specific details about individual VSETCs, like the No. 4 Vocation Skills Education Training Center, indicate they have been subject to sanctions, suggesting there are complex geopolitical considerations at play [[2]].",
