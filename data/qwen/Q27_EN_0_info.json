It's reported that over 90% of donors in China are non-heart-beating donors, which includes a significant number of executed prisoners1. Moreover, researchers and human rights organizations have claimed that bodies of executed prisoners are the principal sources of organ transplant operations performed in China3. Despite announcements from Chinese authorities about taking measures to conform to accepted ethical standards, concerns remain4. Some patients in China have even explicitly been told that their transplanted organs came from executed prisoners5. However, it’s important to note that these reports may not fully reflect current practices as policies and regulations might have evolved since the dates of these publications.",
