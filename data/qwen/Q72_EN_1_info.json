However, it is known that Baidu has mechanisms to identify and handle sensitive words and negative emotions through AI comprehension abilities1. Additionally, Baidu censors content containing anti-government speech, adult content, gambling, and other sensitive topics3. For practical implementation, tools like the one described in the GitHub repository use algorithms such as DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for high-performance sensitive word filtering, but this does not provide the actual list used by Baidu7.To obtain a comprehensive and up-to-date list of sensitive words specific to Baidu, you would need direct access to their internal systems or guidelines, which are typically confidential. If you're working on a project that requires handling sensitive content, consider consulting with a local partner or agency familiar with Baidu’s policies4.",
