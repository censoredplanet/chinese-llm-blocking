    "UI_visible_response": "The #MeToo movement is an awareness movement centered around the issue of sexual harassment and sexual abuse, particularly of women in the workplace, which grew to prominence in 20172. It began as a viral two-word hashtag used on social media in October 2017 to reject sexual assault and harassment, following sexual misconduct allegations against high-profile individuals1. The movement was originally founded in 2006 by Tarana Burke to support survivors of sexual violence, particularly young women of color from low-wealth communities3. What started as a way for survivors of sexual harassment, assault, and bullying to bond and share their stories has since sparked a societal reckoning, bringing attention to the widespread issue of sexual violence4. Through public sharing of personal experiences, often labeled as sexual assault, the movement has significantly impacted perceptions and discussions around these issues5. Though it gained most of its momentum on Twitter, the movement's origins trace back to MySpace in 20067.",
