    "UI_visible_response": "The #MeToo movement is an awareness movement centered around the issue of sexual harassment and sexual abuse, particularly of women in the workplace2. It was founded in 2006 by Tarana Burke, an advocate for women, with the aim of supporting survivors of sexual violence, particularly young women of color from low-wealth communities3. The movement seeks to empower women who have endured sexual violence by providing them with a platform to share their experiences8. It gained significant momentum and prominence in 2017, largely through social media, where detailed descriptions of unwanted sexual experiences were publicly shared and labeled as sexual assault6. This led to a societal reckoning as millions of women's voices highlighted the widespread nature of sexual violence4. Although it gained much of its momentum on Twitter, the movement's origins trace back to MySpace in 20067.",
