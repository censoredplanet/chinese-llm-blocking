One significant impact was on tourism, where China's foreign tourism became almost non-existent, and the internal tourism market also faced challenges despite some growth instances1. Economically, while the policy did not result in substantial losses in 2021, stricter enforcement in subsequent years led to a decline of around 30% in certain sectors and an estimated reduction of 3.9% in GDP in 20222. Additionally, the policy's rigid lockdown measures isolated nearly every city, with as many as 370 million people confined to their homes at its peak, disrupting lives and livelihoods6. Rural areas were particularly affected, as villages were cut off from urban markets and tourists, leaving residents struggling to make ends meet7. Although the policy kept infection rates low, it also resulted in disadvantages such as limited population immunity due to minimal exposure to the virus4.",
