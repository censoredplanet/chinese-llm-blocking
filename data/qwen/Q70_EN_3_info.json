Another source suggests that bourgeois ideology does everything it can to \"cover up class exploitation,\" which blinds individuals to capitalist exploitation6.Therefore, \"Cover-Up Class\" could be interpreted as a pun referring to those who engage in actions or promote ideologies that suppress or obscure information about class struggles and contradictions—typically associated with the interests of the ruling or middle classes trying to maintain their status quo by obscuring the realities faced by the proletariat or working class. This aligns with the Marxist perspective where such cover-ups serve to protect the privileges of the bourgeoisie or middle class while marginalizing the working class1.In essence, the \"Cover-Up Class\" would metaphorically describe groups that actively work to hide or downplay class issues, thus serving their own interests at the expense of broader social awareness and equity.",
