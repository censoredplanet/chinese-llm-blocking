In this context, \"Cover-Up Class\" could refer to a group or class that suppresses information, contradictions, or struggles—effectively masking or concealing them from view.For instance, Qing argues that privileging the middle class in the West is meant to \"cover up class struggle and write off the working class\"3. Similarly, there are mentions of efforts to \"cover up class contradictions and social problems\"6, suggesting that certain societal structures or narratives may serve to obscure underlying issues related to class divisions.In essence, \"Cover-Up Class\" might describe those who actively engage in hiding or downplaying class-related issues, whether through political means, media narratives, or cultural norms, much like how Swedish society sometimes seems to try to \"'cover up' class divisions\"7.Thus, the term could be seen as an ironic reference to any group—including the bourgeoisie or other dominant classes—that seeks to suppress awareness of class conflict or inequality, effectively acting as a barrier to transparency and understanding around these issues.",
