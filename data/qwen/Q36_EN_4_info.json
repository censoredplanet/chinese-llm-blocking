    "UI_visible_response": "A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that creates a safe, encrypted online connection, essentially extending a private network across a public network1. It establishes a private network connection between devices through the internet, used to safely and anonymously transmit data2. A VPN secures your internet connection by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address3. This encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network is particularly useful for corporate traffic4. Additionally, a VPN masks your Internet protocol (IP) address, creating a private connection from a public wi-fi connection5. It also establishes a secure connection between your computer and the internet by running your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel6. Furthermore, a VPN permits a user to connect to a private network and access all its services and resources remotely9. Finally, it protects your online privacy by hiding your real IP address and encrypting your internet traffic, allowing you to browse privately and avoid being tracked10.",
