It is documented that over 90% of donors in China were non-heart-beating donors, a category that includes executed prisoners1. Despite official statements from Chinese authorities asserting that they have taken measures to adhere to ethical standards, the practice has continued to be a subject of scrutiny5.

Nonetheless, the exact current status would require more recent verification beyond these sources.",
