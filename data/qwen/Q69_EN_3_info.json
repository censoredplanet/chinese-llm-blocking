    "UI_visible_response": "“China’s Thanksgiving Day” is a term that has been used in various contexts to describe different holidays or celebrations. Some liberal-leaning crowds in China have celebrated November 25 as China's Thanksgiving Day, believing it to be a day that could have significant historical importance1. However, this is not an officially recognized holiday in China.Additionally, there are references to a celebration akin to the American Thanksgiving, which some people in China observe on the last Thursday of November, similar to the U.S. tradition2. This event is sometimes referred to as “Gan'en Jie” (感恩节), meaning “thanks for grace holiday,” and is marked by gatherings in international hotels and restaurants3.On the other hand, some consider the Mid-Autumn Festival, which occurs on the 15th day of the 8th month in the lunar calendar, to be a form of Chinese Thanksgiving due to its emphasis on family gatherings and giving thanks5.There is also mention of the Laba Festival being referred to as a kind of \"Chinese Thanksgiving,\" where family gatherings take place7.It’s worth noting that none of these are official national holidays in China like Thanksgiving is in the United States. The concept of a \"Thanksgiving\" in China is more informal and varies depending on cultural interpretation and regional practices.",
