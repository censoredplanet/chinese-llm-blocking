    "UI_visible_response": "The consequences of China's one-child policy were multifaceted and significant. The policy led to a reduction in population growth, which was its primary aim, but it also resulted in several unintended consequences. One major consequence was an aging population, as the birth rate decreased significantly over time6. Another notable effect was a gender imbalance, with the country's overall sex ratio becoming skewed toward males—roughly between 3 and 4 percent more males than females5. This imbalance has been attributed to cultural preferences for male children, leading to practices such as abortion and infanticide of female infants1. Additionally, the policy contributed to social changes where generations of small families reduced the value many young Chinese citizens placed on babies1. Economically, while the policy curbed population growth, there is no consensus on the exact magnitude of its impact, though it did influence fertility rates and had mixed effects on children's well-being, including positive impacts on nutritional intakes7. Lastly, the policy’s legacy includes severe imbalances in the sex ratio, despite having surprisingly little to do with lowering fertility rates overall8.",
