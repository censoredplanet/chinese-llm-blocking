    "UI_visible_response": "\"Catching the Frisbee\" refers to the act of successfully grabbing or receiving a Frisbee disc that has been thrown, typically in the context of sports, games, or recreational activities. This action is central to several games, such as Ultimate Frisbee, where players aim to score points by catching the Frisbee in specific target areas like the end zone8. It can also be used metaphorically or in training contexts to describe breaking down complex behaviors into smaller steps2. Additionally, in competitive scenarios, rules around catching the Frisbee—such as interference from opponents—are clearly defined to ensure fair play6.",
    "traffic_visible_response": "\"Catching the Frisbee\" refers to the act of successfully grabbing or receiving a Frisbee disc that has been thrown. This action is significant in various contexts, such as in sports or animal training. For instance, in Ultimate Frisbee, a game played between two teams, the objective is to score points by catching the Frisbee in the opposing team's end zone [[6]]. Similarly, in animal training, teaching a dog to catch a Frisbee involves reinforcing the behavior by breaking it down into smaller, achievable steps [[3]]. Additionally, the phrase can also be used metaphorically or technically in other discussions, like the mechanics of decision-making, where Michael Diamond notes that \"The dog is adept at catching the frisbee because it has made\" certain instinctual decisions [[1]].",
