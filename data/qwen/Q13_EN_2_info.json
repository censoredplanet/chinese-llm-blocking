    "UI_visible_response": "The number of deaths attributable to air pollution in China has varied over recent years according to different studies and estimates. In 2017, it was estimated that 1.24 million deaths were attributable to air pollution in China1. By 2019, this figure had increased slightly to 1.85 million deaths as a result of air pollution4. Another source mentions that air pollution is responsible for about 2 million deaths in China per year, with ambient air pollution alone causing more than 1 million deaths3. More recent estimates continue to indicate that approximately 1 million people die every year from air pollution in China, primarily due to particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM105.It's important to note that these figures can fluctuate based on changes in air quality, policy interventions, and other factors affecting pollution levels.",
