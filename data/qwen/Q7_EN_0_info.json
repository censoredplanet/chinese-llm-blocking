    "UI_visible_response": "The One-Child Policy in China, which was implemented to control population growth, led to several significant consequences. One of the most notable demographic issues was an elevated sex ratio, resulting in roughly 3 to 4 percent more males than females due to cultural preferences for male children4. This imbalance has had lasting social implications.Another major consequence was rapid population aging, contributing to an increasingly elderly population that has placed economic and social burdens on Chinese society2. Alongside these challenges, the policy also resulted in a shrinking workforce, which could affect long-term economic growth5.Additionally, there were severe human rights concerns associated with enforcement. Forced abortions and sterilizations were reported as methods used by authorities to ensure compliance with the policy3. The psychological and societal impacts of such measures have been profound, reducing the value many young Chinese citizens place on babies and altering family dynamics1.There were also legal and social complications arising from the proliferation of undocumented, non-first-born children who faced barriers in obtaining legal status or leaving the country7. Despite its intentions, the One-Child Policy had surprisingly little effect on lowering fertility rates but did lead to other serious issues like gender imbalance6. On a positive note, it was linked with improvements in nutritional intakes among children9.",
