    "UI_visible_response": "The concept of \"China's Thanksgiving Day\" is not officially recognized in China as a national holiday, but there are a few interpretations and celebrations that have been associated with this idea. Some liberal-leaning crowds in China have celebrated November 25 as China's Thanksgiving Day, drawing parallels to the American holiday1. However, this is more of an informal observance rather than a widely accepted or traditional Chinese festival.In terms of cultural or historical context, some people refer to the Mid-Autumn Festival as being similar to Thanksgiving because it emphasizes family gatherings and giving thanks, although it is traditionally focused on moon worship and related legends8. Additionally, the Laba Festival, which occurs on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, has also been likened to a thanksgiving-type celebration due to its emphasis on family and feasting5.It’s worth noting that while Thanksgiving as known in America doesn’t have a direct equivalent in China, the sentiment of gratitude and family gathering resonates with several traditional Chinese festivals like the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Spring Festival9. Thus, “China’s Thanksgiving Day” could be seen as a way to describe these existing traditions through a lens familiar to Western cultures.",
