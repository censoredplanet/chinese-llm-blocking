    "UI_visible_response": "The provided information does not specify the exact reasons why Wang Quanzhang filed a complaint against public security officials in Tianjin. However, it is mentioned that Wang Quanzhang was involved in legal proceedings and faced significant restrictions on his freedom, including being held in incommunicado detention for nearly three years prior to his sentencing3. Additionally, he was sentenced to 4½ years in prison by a court in Tianjin on charges related to subverting state power2. These circumstances suggest that any complaints he might have filed could be related to his treatment during detention or the legal process against him, but without more specific information, this remains speculative. If you need detailed information about his specific complaints, further research would be necessary.",
