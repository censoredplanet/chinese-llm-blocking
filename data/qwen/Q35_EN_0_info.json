They may be blocked from using dating sites and unable to enroll their children in preferred schools1. Additionally, if someone’s trustworthiness score is low, they might encounter limitations on the selection of schools available for their children and could even experience throttled internet speeds as a form of punishment2. People with low scores might also be restricted from leaving their domicile until their score improves3. Other repercussions include being placed on blacklists that result in flight bans, exclusion from private schools, and slower internet connections4.
