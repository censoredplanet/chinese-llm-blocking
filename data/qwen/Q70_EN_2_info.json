Similarly, there is mention of how bourgeois ideology attempts to cover up class exploitation, preventing the proletariat from recognizing their own exploitation5. Thus, \"Cover-Up Class\" could metaphorically describe those who actively work to suppress awareness of class issues, much like the bourgeoisie allegedly use nationalism or patriotism as tools to divert attention from these underlying tensions7.",
