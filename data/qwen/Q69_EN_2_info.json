    "UI_visible_response": "“China’s Thanksgiving Day” is not an officially recognized traditional holiday in China, but there are a few interpretations and celebrations that connect the concept of thanksgiving to Chinese culture. Some liberal-leaning crowds in China have celebrated November 25 as “China's Thanksgiving Day,” although this celebration is not mainstream and has certain political undertones tied to it1.Another interpretation relates the idea of thanksgiving to the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋节, Zhōng Qiū Jié), which occurs on the 15th day of the 8th month in the lunar calendar. This festival emphasizes family gatherings, gratitude, and giving thanks, much like Thanksgiving in Western cultures, though it is more focused on moon worship and harvest traditions6.Additionally, there are references to the Laba Festival (腊八节, Làbā Jié) being considered a form of “Chinese Thanksgiving.” The Laba Festival falls on the 8th day of the 12th lunar month and involves family gatherings and feasts, similar to Thanksgiving celebrations7.In modern times, some people in China, particularly those influenced by Western culture, have also begun celebrating the American Thanksgiving by gathering with friends and family for a meal, often involving elements such as turkey and other international dishes8.Therefore, while there isn’t one single established “China’s Thanksgiving Day,” several festivals or occasions carry themes of gratitude and thankfulness, depending on cultural, historical, or contemporary influences.",
