This surveillance is not limited to physical spaces but extends into digital realms, impacting daily life significantly. For instance, state surveillance has become a pervasive aspect of life in China, with citizens developing various mental tactics to cope with the omnipresent digital oversight4.In particular regions like Xinjiang, mass surveillance has been reported to target specific ethnic groups, notably Muslims, through the use of a mobile app that facilitates both surveillance and arbitrary detentions3. The technology and methods employed in these surveillance operations are sophisticated, involving facial recognition and other biometric data collection tools used by police agencies across China’s cities, which have more CCTV cameras than any other cities globally5.Furthermore, the scale of this surveillance infrastructure is supported by major tech companies within China, such as Dahua, the second-largest surveillance camera manufacturer worldwide, highlighting how deeply embedded surveillance technologies are within the country’s technological sector7. These developments underscore the significant role that technology plays in enhancing the reach and effectiveness of state surveillance in China.",
