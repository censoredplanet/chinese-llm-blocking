    "UI_visible_response": "\"China's Thanksgiving Day\" is not an officially recognized holiday in China, but there are a few different interpretations and celebrations that could be associated with the term. One interpretation is that for over a decade, some of China's liberal-leaning crowds have celebrated November 25 as China's Thanksgiving Day, although this seems to be more of an informal observance rather than a widely acknowledged national event1.Another perspective comes from the idea that the Mid-Autumn Festival might be likened to a \"Thanksgiving\" celebration due to its focus on family gatherings and giving thanks, even though it has its own distinct cultural significance and traditions unrelated to the American Thanksgiving10. The Mid-Autumn Festival traditionally involves moon worship and celebrates the harvest with foods like mooncakes rather than turkey or pumpkin pie.Additionally, there is mention of a \"Chinese Thanksgiving\" being associated with the Laba Festival, which occurs on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month according to the Chinese calendar, though this festival is more about commemorating the enlightenment of the Buddha6.It should be noted that Thanksgiving is not a traditional Chinese holiday, and while some people, particularly those in urban areas or expatriate communities, might celebrate it, it does not hold the same historical or cultural weight as it does in countries like the United States8. In Chinese, if one were to refer to Thanksgiving, they would use the term 感恩节 (gǎn ēn jié), which translates literally to \"thanks for grace holiday\"3.",
