    "UI_visible_response": "\"Little Pink\" refers to a label that emerged around 2016 for a new wave of female-led cyber-nationalism in China, often associated with nationalistic views regarding issues like Taiwan2. The term became popular as a description for young, seemingly naïve girls who were initially interested in romantic stories but later engaged in politics4. However, it has been argued that \"Little Pink\" is not just a straightforward descriptor; rather, it is a manufactured and mythologized label used by various cyber groups to challenge or rebuke certain nationalistic visions1. Additionally, the label carries gendered connotations, which have been utilized by conflicting groups attempting to reframe its imagery3. This phenomenon gained enough traction that even cultural figures, such as Malaysian rapper Namewee, have had run-ins with individuals labeled as \"Little Pinks,\" leading to controversy and bans on his music in China5.",
