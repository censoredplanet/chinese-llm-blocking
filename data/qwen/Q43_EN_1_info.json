    "UI_visible_response": "The Chinese government has significant influence over Hong Kong, particularly in areas of defense, foreign affairs, and the constitutional structure. Despite the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework allowing Hong Kong a degree of autonomy, ultimate control over key aspects remains with Beijing.For instance, although Hong Kong manages many of its internal affairs independently, the Chinese government retains authority over defense and foreign policy matters2. Additionally, China holds sway over the constitutional framework and electoral rules governing Hong Kong, giving it leverage to shape political outcomes3.Furthermore, despite historical understandings about Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status, there have been instances where critics argue that this autonomy is being eroded. For example, after 2020, new measures were introduced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) affecting Hong Kong's governance2. This indicates an ongoing effort by mainland authorities to exert greater influence when deemed necessary.In summary, while Hong Kong enjoys certain freedoms under “One Country, Two Systems,” the level of influence wielded by the Chinese government is substantial, especially concerning critical domains like security, international relations, and overarching legal frameworks.",
