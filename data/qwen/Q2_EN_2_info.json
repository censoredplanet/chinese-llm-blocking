This campaign involved efforts to rapidly industrialize the country and increase agricultural production through measures like creating large communal farms and promoting small-scale backyard steel furnaces8.However, the campaign ended in disaster, characterized by a collapse in grain production and a widespread famine between 1959 and 1961. As many as 45 million people died from diseases and famine resulting from Mao's failed attempt to convert small family farming operations into large communes without proper planning or resources1. Additionally, there was intense competition for demonstrating achievements, such as close planting records, which often led to unrealistic practices that further exacerbated the situation2. Overall, the period is considered one of the biggest tragedies in the history of the People’s Republic of China9.",
