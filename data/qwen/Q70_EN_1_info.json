However, based on your description and the context you've given, we can infer a meaning. If we interpret it as a pun on \"proletariat,\" it would refer to a group of people who are involved in suppressing information, particularly about class struggles and contradictions.This idea aligns with some of the concepts mentioned in the knowledge base, such as the privileging of the middle class being used to cover up class struggle and write off the working class1. Similarly, there is mention of bourgeois ideology doing everything it can to cover up class exploitation6. These sources suggest that certain classes or groups might indeed engage in covering up class-related issues to maintain their status or power.Therefore, \"Cover-Up Class\" could metaphorically describe those within the bourgeoisie or other privileged classes who suppress information regarding class struggles to maintain their dominance and control over the proletariat or working class. This suppression helps them to perpetuate systems that favor their interests while obscuring the realities of class exploitation from public view.",
