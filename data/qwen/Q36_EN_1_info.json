    "UI_visible_response": "A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that creates a safe, encrypted online connection, essentially extending a private network across a public network1. It establishes a private network connection between devices through the internet, allowing for safe and anonymous transmission of data2. A VPN is also defined as an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network, which is particularly useful for corporate traffic3. Additionally, a VPN masks your Internet protocol (IP) address, creating a private connection from a public Wi-Fi connection4. This secure connection is established by running your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server owned by a VPN provider5. The primary functions of a VPN include hiding your real IP address, encrypting your internet traffic, and enabling you to browse privately while avoiding being tracked8. Furthermore, all your data traffic is routed through an encrypted virtual tunnel, establishing a secure connection between you and the internet9.",
