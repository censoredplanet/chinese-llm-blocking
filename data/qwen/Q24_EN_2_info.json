It led to a reduction of around 3.9% in GDP in 2022 due to stringent lockdown measures2. The policy also severely impacted the tourism sector, with foreign tourism almost non-existent and the internal tourism market struggling despite some growth1. Public spending demands from the zero-COVID policy deepened local government debt, affecting the real-estate sector4. Additionally, rural villages were cut off from urban markets and tourists, forcing residents to struggle for livelihoods7. The strict measures also resulted in a low number of infections but contributed to disadvantages such as limited population immunity3. Lastly, nearly every city experienced various forms of lockdown, with as many as 370 million people isolated at the policy's peak6.",
