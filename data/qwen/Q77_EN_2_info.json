    "UI_visible_response": "The unavailability of certain content, such as the environmental documentary in question, on the Chinese internet could be due to the strict internet regulations and censorship policies implemented by the Chinese government. These regulations control what websites and content are accessible from within mainland China4. Additionally, if the documentary was hosted on a platform not officially available in China, like Netflix, which isn't allowed in China2, or if it touched upon sensitive topics related to air pollution that might be closely monitored or restricted, this would also explain its unavailability1. To access such content, individuals in mainland China might need to use a virtual private network (VPN)5, although even then, there's no guarantee of access due to the sophisticated filtering systems in place.",
    "traffic_visible_response": "The documentary you're referring to is likely \"Under the Dome,\" an environmental documentary by Chai Jing that went viral for its direct linkage of air pollution to human health, bringing a personal perspective to China's air pollution issues [[1]]. However, it's important to note that the Chinese internet is heavily regulated, and many foreign websites and services, including those that might host such documentaries, are not accessible without using a virtual private network (VPN). This regulation includes platforms like Google, Facebook, and Instagram, which require a VPN to access from within mainland China [[4]]. Additionally, while Netflix isn't allowed in mainland China, it operates in other regions like Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, but these do not include mainland China as part of its market [[2]]. Therefore, if the documentary was hosted on a platform not available in mainland China or was removed due to regulatory pressures, it would explain why it is unavailable on the Chinese internet.",
