These words are often categorized and listed in regulatory appendices, with some requiring the endorsement of an official body before being utilized2. Additionally, sensitive words can also refer to expressions that are context-dependent, changing meaning based on the situation, much like chameleons adapting to their environment4. In broader communication, these terms might relate to delicate subjects such as profanity, racism, sexuality, or religion, and vary across different cultures5. Therefore, handling sensitive words requires careful consideration and appropriate usage to ensure clarity and avoid offense.",
