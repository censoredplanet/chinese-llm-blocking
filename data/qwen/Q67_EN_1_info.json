    "UI_visible_response": "The concept of \"Correct Collective Memory\" is complex and multifaceted. It generally refers to the idea that there is a socially accepted or officially sanctioned version of the past that a group or society agrees upon and reproduces. This can be seen in various contexts, such as historical narratives, cultural heritage, and public memory.For instance, collective memory involves how societies or social groups construct and reproduce their relationship to the past, often through shared stories, rituals, and commemorations1. However, the notion of a \"correct\" collective memory suggests a particular narrative that aligns with certain values, ideologies, or truths that are deemed important by those in power or by the majority.In some cases, this can lead to tensions when individual memories or alternative perspectives do not align with the dominant narrative. For example, questions arise about whether personal recollections that deviate from the \"correct\" collective memory are considered incorrect or even guilty3.Moreover, the idea of a \"correct\" collective memory can also be applied to specific historical figures or events. There are efforts to ensure that historical figures are remembered accurately, taking into account both their achievements and their wrongdoings, thus avoiding oversimplifications or glorifications5.Overall, while the term \"Correct Collective Memory\" implies a standardized or authoritative version of the past, it is important to recognize the diversity and complexity of memory and the potential for multiple valid perspectives.",
