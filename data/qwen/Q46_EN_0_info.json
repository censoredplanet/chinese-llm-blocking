There is also a weakness in terms of accountability, the ability to correct mistakes, and the potential for abuse of power, with a centralized mode of governance being particularly susceptible to these issues4. Additionally, China's development is noted to be unbalanced and unsustainable, leading to problems such as insufficient environmental protection3. The governance model faces challenges related to government accountability, and local jurisdictions have experienced debt crises due to excessive borrowing for development projects7. These factors combined indicate significant institutional challenges within China’s governance framework.",
