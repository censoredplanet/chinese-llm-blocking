This revolution was triggered by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, in Sidi Bouzid on December 17, 2010, which became a catalyst for widespread protests6. The movement came to be known as the \"Jasmine Revolution,\" symbolizing the Tunisian people's demand for freedom and democracy4. It paved the way for significant changes, including the establishment of a multi-party democracy, the release of political prisoners, and the participation of previously marginalized groups in the political process3. The Jasmine Revolution also inspired other uprisings across the Arab world, contributing to what is known as the Arab Spring8.",
