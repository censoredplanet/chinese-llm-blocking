One such benefit includes its potential to improve food security in Africa as part of a low-carbon future, due to Africa having the lowest levels of access to food2. Additionally, it has been found that the BRI has a positive long-term impact on the green innovation behavior of enterprises3.However, there are also negative consequences attributed to the BRI. The natural ecological niche showed a negative growth following the initiative's implementation, affecting the coupling coordination of economic-social ecological niches4. Furthermore, it has been argued that the adverse impacts on low-income countries and the environment outweigh the benefits of the BRI5. There are also risks involved, including biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, or elite capture, which could be especially significant6. Concerns about the environmental implications are prominent, with predictions suggesting BRI projects could increase global warming by 3 degrees Celsius, potentially forcing over 100 million people in Asia into extreme poverty7. China's policies through the BRI have also been criticized for their overwhelmingly adverse environmental effects, particularly through coal dumping in developing countries8.",
