For example, when discussing exhibitions exploring overshadowed histories, it becomes clear that presenting a \"correct\" collective memory involves reevaluating figures like Picton and Colston, ensuring they aren't remembered only for their glorified actions but also for their controversial ones5.Moreover, concerns over bodily guilt for holding deviant memories suggest tensions between personal experiences and official narratives: “When they say that there is a 'correct' collective memory… is my body guilty for holding a piece of memory that deviates from it?”3.
