In 2017, it was estimated that 1.24 million deaths were attributable to air pollution1. By 2019, this figure had increased slightly to 1.85 million deaths3. More recent estimates suggest that around 1 million people continue to die each year from air pollution, primarily due to particulate matter such as PM2.5 and PM104. Additionally, indoor air pollution contributed to approximately 394,000 deaths5. These figures highlight the ongoing significant impact of air pollution on public health in China.",
