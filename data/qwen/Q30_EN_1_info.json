    "UI_visible_response": "Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of Wang Quanzhang filing a complaint against public security officials in Tianjin. However, it is noted that Wang Quanzhang, a prominent human rights lawyer, was sentenced to 4½ years in prison by a court in Tianjin, China, on charges that were criticized internationally. His case has been described as a \"cruel charade\" and a \"sham trial,\" with accusations of subverting state power2. Additionally, there were attempts by Tianjin police to investigate his colleagues, which they refused, after Wang had been held incommunicado for nearly three years3. These elements suggest a context of legal and procedural controversy surrounding Wang Quanzhang’s case, but do not specifically address a complaint filed by him against public security officials. If you have more specific details or sources, please provide them for a more accurate response.",
