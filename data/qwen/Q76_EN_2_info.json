    "UI_visible_response": "\"Under the Dome\" is a work of very broad, very black social satire, where the individual characters don't seem to matter very much, according to a review in Bookforum1. It is also described as a thriller about a small town suddenly and inexplicably sealed off from the rest of the world by an enormous transparent dome, originating from the mind of Stephen King3. Additionally, it has been characterized as a microcosm of society, offering a profound examination of how individuals and communities respond to an unprecedented crisis5. The television adaptation is noted as broadcast television's most enjoyable science-fiction/fantasy series by Ken Tucker of Yahoo!4, and it explores the dark side of humans in captivity through its sci-fi drama format6.",
