    "UI_visible_response": "A virtual private network (VPN) is a service that creates a safe, encrypted online connection, essentially extending a private network across a public network1. It establishes a private network connection between devices through the internet, allowing for safe and anonymous transmission of data2. A VPN secures your internet connection by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address3. This encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network is particularly useful for corporate traffic4. Additionally, a VPN masks your Internet protocol (IP) address, creating a private connection even from a public wi-fi connection5. It also establishes a secure connection between your computer and the internet by running your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel6. Overall, a VPN provides a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider7.",
