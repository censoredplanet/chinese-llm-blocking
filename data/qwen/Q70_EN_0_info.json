    "UI_visible_response": "The phrase \"Cover-Up Class\" seems to be a creative pun that combines the concept of concealing or suppressing information with the traditional Marxist notion of class struggle. In Marxist theory, the \"proletariat\" refers to the working class, who, according to Marx, are exploited by the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class). However, in this context, the term \"Cover-Up Class\" could be interpreted as referring to a group—potentially those in power or the middle/upper classes—who engage in efforts to obscure or suppress class contradictions and struggles.For instance, Qing argues that privileging the middle class in the West is meant to \"cover up class struggle and write off the working class\"1. This suggests that certain societal structures or narratives may be designed to mask underlying social inequalities and prevent the recognition of ongoing class conflicts.Thus, \"Cover-Up Class\" might humorously or critically refer to those who actively work to suppress awareness of class issues, possibly aligning with the idea of the bourgeoisie or other dominant groups using strategies to maintain their status while downplaying or hiding the realities faced by the proletariat4.It's important to note that this interpretation blends both literal and metaphorical understandings of \"covering up\" and applies them to class dynamics.",
