On the positive side, the initiative has been linked to improvements in green innovation behavior among enterprises in the long term, suggesting that it could foster sustainable development3. Additionally, the BRI has contributed to China's economic growth and expansion, offering new opportunities for trade and investment8. In Africa, one positive effect is its potential to improve food security as part of a low-carbon future, which could address some critical issues on the continent2.However, there are also notable negative results. For instance, increased competition from Chinese exports has negatively impacted other markets within BRI countries4. The natural ecological niche showed a negative growth after the implementation of the BRI, indicating environmental challenges5. Furthermore, while the initiative would lead to a modest increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, this underscores the complex set of positive and negative outcomes at the national level1. There are also concerns about corruption, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and the negative impact on low-income countries, which have been shown to outweigh some benefits6. These risks may be particularly significant in certain contexts7.",
