However, there are a few references that might indirectly relate to the term:In the context of Chinese history, the Yuan dynasty had successive rulers, with Chengzong (Temur) being the second Yuan emperor who reigned from 1294 to 13073.The term could also be used in financial contexts, such as when China allowed the Bank of East Asia (BEA) to sell a second issuance of yuan bonds in Hong Kong1, or when banks were asked to submit bids for a second Yuan auction in Nigeria2.Without additional context, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what \"Second Yuan\" refers to, but these instances provide possible interpretations related to either historical succession or financial events. If you have more specific context or details, I can refine the answer further.",
