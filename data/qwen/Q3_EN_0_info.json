They were a quartet of political and economic radicals who emerged as powerbrokers during this period, manipulating the youthful Red Guards and controlling areas such as intellectual education, basic theories in social sciences, and teacher-student relations [[4]]. The Gang was particularly strong and influential in the fields of propaganda and cultural affairs, which led to a dry and dogmatic rigidity in these areas [[1]]. They promoted the Cultural Revolution and wished to maintain the totalitarian policies of Mao [[5]]. In 1966, they were involved in a significant struggle led by Mao that aimed at purging the party and state apparatus [[2]]. After Mao's death, Jiang Qing, a key member of the Gang, plotted a coup d'Ã©tat to seize power. However, she and her close associates in the Gang of Four were arrested and put on trial [[10]]. The campaign against the Gang of Four continued the struggle that had been ongoing in China since the launching of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution [[6]].
