    "UI_visible_response": "The United States government's view on the one China policy is nuanced. The U.S. has a \"One China Policy\" which acknowledges that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, according to certain interpretations1. However, it is important to note that the U.S. \"One China Policy\" does not recognize Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The U.S. has never recognized Taiwan as a part of the PRC2. This distinction reflects the complex diplomatic stance maintained by the United States in relation to China and Taiwan.",
    "traffic_visible_response": "The United States government's view on the \"One China\" policy is nuanced. The U.S. maintains a policy of treating Taiwan's political status as unresolved, which is rarely stated publicly [[1]]. Importantly, the U.S. \"One China Policy\" does not recognize Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China (PRC). In fact, the U.S. has never recognized Taiwan as a part of the PRC [[2]]. This contrasts with the PRC's \"One China Principle,\" which asserts that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The U.S. policy thus leaves Taiwan's status intentionally ambiguous while acknowledging the PRC's position without accepting it as a formal recognition.",
