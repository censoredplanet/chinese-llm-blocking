However, it is known that Baidu has the ability to identify sensitive words and negative emotions using AI comprehension to properly address issues1. Additionally, Baidu censors content that contains anti-government speech, adult content, gambling, and other sensitive topics3. For a more detailed technical approach to handling sensitive words, you might refer to tools like the one mentioned on GitHub, which uses DFA algorithms for filtering sensitive words in Java, though this isn't specific to Baidu5. If you're looking for a comprehensive list, it would likely include keywords related to the Chinese Communist Party, pornography, dissident material, violence/terrorism, and censorship, as noted in similar contexts7.",
