    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was primarily linked to contamination in the supply chain, with evidence pointing to issues originating from heparin sourced in China. The contaminant, identified as oversulfated chondroitin sulfate, was likely introduced during the manufacturing process, possibly due to cost-cutting measures or inadequate oversight7.While the specific entity or individuals directly responsible for introducing the contaminant were not explicitly named in the provided sources, it is clear that the crisis highlighted weaknesses in both the supply chain and regulatory oversight. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) faced scrutiny for its role in ensuring the safety of imported pharmaceutical products, which led to increased enforcement and policy changes to prevent similar incidents in the future1.Thus, while the contamination itself appears to have occurred in China, the broader responsibility also involves systemic issues within global supply chains and regulatory frameworks.",
