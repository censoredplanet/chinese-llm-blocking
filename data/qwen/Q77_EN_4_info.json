The Chinese-controlled internet is a world apart from that used by the rest of the globe, split by censorship that blocks users in China from accessing various types of content2. This includes environmental documentaries that might address sensitive topics like air pollution, which could hit close to home and bring a personal perspective to issues such as China's air pollution1. Additionally, there are specific networking techniques implemented by the Chinese government to control what websites are accessible from within mainland China, which may result in the blocking of certain documentaries or films deemed inappropriate or controversial4. If a documentary has been removed or is unavailable, it could also point to political censorship and heightened regulation of online services in China6.",
