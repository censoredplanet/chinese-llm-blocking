Reports suggest that these centers have been associated with forced labor and reeducation campaigns. For instance, witness accounts confirm that employment linked to VSETCs can constitute a severe form of forced labor, where workers are often paid negligible wages1. Additionally, it has been argued that China’s campaign in the XUAR involves reeducation and forced labor through these so-called “Vocational Skills” programs3.These findings highlight the coercive nature of such programs and the significant concerns regarding the treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim groups in these facilities.",
