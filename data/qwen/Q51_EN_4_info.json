Chen, a critic of such policies, has described it as a system that enforces severe limitations on press freedom and internet access, suggesting it dilutes fundamental human rights like the sacredness of human life due to practices such as forced abortions1. Similarly, other sources describe it as a digital barrier akin to the historical Berlin Wall, effectively isolating populations from free-flowing global information; this concept was even linked to projects allegedly serviced by major tech entities like Google, though those were abandoned2.
