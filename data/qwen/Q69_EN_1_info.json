    "UI_visible_response": "“China’s Thanksgiving Day” is not an official or traditional Chinese holiday but rather a modern celebration that has been informally adopted, particularly among liberal-leaning crowds in China. It is celebrated on November 25th, and it has been referred to as \"Gan'en Jie\" (感恩节), which translates to “thanks for grace holiday”3. This day is seen as an opportunity for people to express gratitude, similar to the American Thanksgiving, where family members gather to have dinner and engage in various traditions5. Some sources suggest that this celebration is inspired by the American Thanksgiving, with celebrations occurring on the last Thursday of November2. However, it's worth noting that there is no widespread or officially recognized \"Thanksgiving\" in China akin to the U.S. version; instead, some view the Mid-Autumn Festival or the Moon Festival as a more authentic form of a Chinese thanksgiving6. Additionally, there are other festivals like the Laba Festival, which could be considered as having themes of gratitude, though they are not directly equivalent to Thanksgiving8.",
