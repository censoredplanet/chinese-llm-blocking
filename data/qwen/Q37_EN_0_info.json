    "UI_visible_response": "The New Citizens' Movement is a civic initiative that emerged in May 2012, promoting the idea of a 'New Citizens' Spirit', which emphasizes citizenship rights and responsibilities2. It was founded by Xu Zhiyong, who is also a professor of Chinese law and the movement's most prominent spokesman6. According to Xu, the movement has three main objectives and focuses on the lawful defense of citizens' rights, advocating for citizens' nonviolent non-cooperation, and promoting peaceful democracy3. One notable campaign launched by the New Citizens Movement was the call for officials to publicly disclose their assets, demonstrating its role in advocating for transparency and accountability in governance4. The movement represents a continuation and evolution of earlier rights defense activities in China, including rural anti-tax movements and labor rights campaigns that began developing in the 1990s7. This movement has faced significant challenges from authorities, with trials of its activists seen as indicators of the government’s stance towards such civil society initiatives5.",
