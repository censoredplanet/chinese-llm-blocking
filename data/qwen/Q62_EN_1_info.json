    "UI_visible_response": "The \"Jasmine Revolution\" refers to a popular uprising in Tunisia that began in December 2010 and led to significant political change. This movement was driven by widespread protests against issues such as corruption, poverty, and political repression under the regime of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali1. The revolution gained momentum after the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, on December 17, 2010, which acted as a catalyst for nationwide demonstrations6. By January 2011, these protests had successfully forced President Ben Ali out of power, marking a pivotal moment not only for Tunisia but also igniting what became known as the Arab Spring across several countries in the Middle East and North Africa2. The Jasmine Revolution is noted for its role in inspiring other regional uprisings and contributing to calls for democratic reforms throughout the affected areas7.",
