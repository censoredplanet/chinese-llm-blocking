For example, in the context of company names, certain words need approval before the company can be registered because they may imply official endorsement or have other implications1. Additionally, sensitive words can also refer to language that is context-dependent and changes meaning based on the situation, requiring sensitivity to cultural and social nuances4. In some regions, these words might relate to political or social issues where they are subject to censorship or special consideration3.
