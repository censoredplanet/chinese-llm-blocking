Economically, it led to a reduction of around 3.9% in GDP in 2022, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations2. The policy also severely impacted both foreign and internal tourism; foreign tourism was almost non-existent, and the internal tourism market faced challenges despite some growth instances1. Additionally, nearly every city in China experienced various forms of lockdown for three years, with as many as 370 million people isolated in their homes at the policy's peak6. Rural villages were cut off from urban markets and tourists during this period, leaving their inhabitants struggling to make a livelihood7. On the other hand, the policy resulted in a low number of infections among the population, although this came with its own set of disadvantages4. Following the abolition of the zero-COVID policy, there was a surprising decrease in the overall number of patients by almost 50% between 15 and 25 days after the change3.",
