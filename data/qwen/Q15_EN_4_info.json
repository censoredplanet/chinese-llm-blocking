A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another country, thereby masking your IP address and bypassing censorship4. Another option is to use a browser with a built-in VPN, such as Opera, which changes your real IP address to a virtual one, providing an easy way to bypass restrictions3. Additionally, for those seeking legal alternatives, purchasing IPLC or IEPL services can be efficient since these do not pass through the standard filtering mechanisms5. Proxy servers are also mentioned as a potential solution, though they may not always be as reliable as VPNs7.",
