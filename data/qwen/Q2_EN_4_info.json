This campaign was led by Mao Zedong and sought to stimulate the economy by moving away from the Soviet model that China had previously followed3.One of the notable activities during this period was the competition for creating the most striking demonstrations of close planting in agriculture2. However, instead of stimulating the country's economy, the Great Leap Forward resulted in mass starvation and famine due to a collapse in grain production8. It is estimated that between 30 and 45 million people died from diseases and famine as a result of this failed campaign1. The campaign also had devastating impacts on China's economy and society, instigating a severe famine7. Overall, the Great Leap Forward ended in disaster, characterized by widespread famine and significant loss of life4.",
