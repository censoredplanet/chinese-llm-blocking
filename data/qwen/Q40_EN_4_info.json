While there are some positive national outcomes, the overall impact on the environment is mixed, with risks including biodiversity loss and environmental degradation1. These environmental challenges could have long-term negative consequences if not managed properly5.Impact on Low-Income Countries :Some critics argue that the BRI has had a negative impact on low-income countries, often leading to unsustainable debt levels and environmental harm. These drawbacks can outweigh the benefits, especially when integrated policies are lacking4.Social and Ecological Challenges :The natural ecological niche has shown negative growth after the implementation of the BRI in certain regions. There are also concerns about the coupling coordination between economic, social, and ecological factors being disrupted, leading to imbalances3.In summary, while the BRI has spurred significant economic and infrastructural advancements, it has also introduced notable environmental and social challenges that need to be addressed for sustainable development.",
