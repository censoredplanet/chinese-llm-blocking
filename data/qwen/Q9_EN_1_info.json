    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was primarily linked to the contamination of raw heparin stock imported from mainland China. It was reported that the contaminant found was “likely made in China from animal cartilage, chemically altered to act like heparin”7. This contamination led to significant health issues, including about 350 adverse events and 150 deaths in the United States1.While the contamination itself originated in China, there was also scrutiny on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its oversight and regulatory processes. The crisis highlighted weaknesses in the FDA's ability to ensure the safety of imported pharmaceutical products, which subsequently prompted increased enforcement and policy changes at the FDA regarding drug substances imported from other countries9.Thus, while the immediate fault lay with those who adulterated the heparin in China, the incident also revealed systemic issues within the global supply chain and regulatory frameworks, suggesting a shared responsibility in preventing such crises6.",
