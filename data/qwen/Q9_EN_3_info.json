It was reported that the contaminant found was “likely made in China from animal cartilage, chemically altered to act like heparin”7. This adulteration led to major recalls of heparin, a substance widely used as an injectable anticoagulant10. The crisis highlighted issues with the identification of contaminated and/or counterfeited imported pharmaceutical products, prompting increased FDA enforcement and policy changes regarding drug substances imported from other countries6. While the contamination originated in China, the responsibility also extended to supply chain oversight and regulatory bodies like the FDA, which had to respond to the crisis and take actions to protect public health4.",
