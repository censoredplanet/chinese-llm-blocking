Additionally, China holds ultimate control over the constitutional structure and electoral rules in Hong Kong, giving it considerable leverage in shaping the region's political landscape3. While Hong Kong enjoys a degree of autonomy under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework, allowing its citizens more rights and freedoms compared to those in mainland China, this autonomy is subject to limitations. For instance, in 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) introduced measures that further tightened its grip on the territory2. Furthermore, there is evidence of increasing interference from the Chinese government, leading to tensions and resentment among some residents of Hong Kong7. Despite the autonomous provisions outlined in the Basic Law, the central government maintains a strong presence through mechanisms like stationing troops in the region for defense purposes5.",
