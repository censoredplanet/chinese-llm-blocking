Chinese leaders have explicitly stated that there will be \"no western-style democracy\" in China, indicating that the country does not intend to adopt a multi-party electoral system or other features typical of Western democracies1.However, China describes its political system as a form of democracy that serves the people and safeguards development, particularly through institutions like the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which hold annual meetings2. These bodies are portrayed as mechanisms for representing the will of the people, though they operate under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).Despite these claims, China does not hold national elections that allow for competitive political participation, resulting in a Representation score of 0 according to some assessments3. The political system is characterized by one-party rule, with limited democratic activity permitted within the framework established by the CPC4.Local elections do exist in China, but their role is often seen as a tool for governance rather than a means of transferring power between competing groups5. This suggests that while there are elements labeled as \"democratic,\" they function differently compared to traditional democratic systems.",
