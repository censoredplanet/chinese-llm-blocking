One of the most notable demographic issues was an elevated sex ratio, resulting in roughly 3 to 4 percent more males than females due to a cultural preference for male children4. This imbalance has had lasting social implications.Additionally, the policy contributed to rapid population aging, as fewer young people are now available to support an increasing elderly population2. This has raised concerns about the sustainability of the labor force and economic stability.The policy also had unintended effects on society, such as a reduced value placed on babies and children by some young Chinese citizens, partly due to generations experiencing small families, abortion, and infanticide1. Forced abortions and sterilizations were reported as part of the measures used to enforce the policy3.Moreover, while the policy succeeded in significantly curbing population growth, it did not have a clear consensus on its magnitude or impact on fertility rates, though it coincided with improvements in children’s nutritional intakes6. There is evidence suggesting that the policy's influence on lowering fertility rates might have been less impactful than expected, yet it severely affected the sex ratio7.Overall, while the One-Child Policy managed to slow down population growth, it resulted in various challenges including an aging population, gender imbalance, and other unintended sociological consequences5.",
