    "UI_visible_response": "Circumventing the Great Firewall of China can be approached in several ways, though it's important to consider the legal and ethical implications. One of the most common methods is using a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN allows users to bypass censorship by masking their IP address and encrypting their internet connection, making it difficult for the firewall to block access to restricted sites1.Another method involves using specific applications designed to circumvent these restrictions. For instance, the app OpenDoor is a browser with built-in circumvention tools that can be downloaded for free from the App Store2. Additionally, some browsers come with built-in VPN features, such as Opera, which changes your real IP address to a virtual one, thus bypassing the firewall4.Encrypted DNS services are also mentioned as a potential way to bypass certain blocks, including access to sites like TorProject and GitHub6. Besides these, there are other techniques like using proxy servers, which can also help in bypassing censorship, although they may not be as reliable as VPNs8.For those looking to avoid using a VPN, there are alternative methods available, though details on these methods would need to be researched further7.",
