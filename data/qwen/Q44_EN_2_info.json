U.S. lawmakers were worried that ByteDance, the company owning TikTok, might leverage its control over the platform to collect vast amounts of data, posing a risk as it could be influenced by a \"designated foreign adversary\"3. Additionally, the government's actions were based on accusations rather than concrete proof, according to Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky5.
