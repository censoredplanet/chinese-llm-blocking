    "UI_visible_response": "The stigmatization of the term \"Public Intellectual\" (often abbreviated as \"Gongzhi\" in Chinese) on the Chinese internet can be attributed to several factors, as highlighted by various sources:Criticism and Contestation in Cyberspace : The term has become a target of cyber criticism, where netizens have constructed narratives that denigrate public intellectuals. This is partly due to the contest between digitally expressed civility and incivility3. In repressive authoritarian contexts, public intellectuals are often seen as individuals who dare to challenge the party-state, making them susceptible to online criticism and ridicule2.State Manipulation and Popular Discourse : The state's manipulation and the catachresis (misuse or distortion) of the term \"public intellectual\" in popular discourses contribute to its negative connotations. This manipulation affects how the public perceives intellectuals, often associating them with unfavorable traits5.Homophones and Derogatory Connotations : The term \"Gongzhi\" is sometimes used derogatorily because it is a homophone for words with negative meanings. For example, it can connote \"howling monster,\" adding a layer of insult to its use7.Historical Stigma : Historically, intellectuals in China have faced stigma. Even in the late 1980s, intellectuals complained about suffering from the stigma of being at the “stinking bottom” of society4. This historical context adds to the layers of negative perception.Contest over Mainstream Opinion : Some public intellectuals value the diversity of Chinese society, but their views often lead to contentious issues. As such, they may be perceived as misrepresenting mainstream opinion, further fueling their stigmatization9.Rise of Internet Insults : The rise of terms like \"white left\" (baizuo) as internet insults also contributes to the broader trend of demonizing public intellectuals. Renowned figures like Rao Yi, a neurobiologist and public intellectual, have criticized this trend6.In summary, the stigmatization of \"Public Intellectual\" on the Chinese internet results from a combination of state influence, historical context, linguistic nuances, and the dynamics of online discourse that often favor incivility over constructive engagement.",
