This system is well-known for its scale and reach, with public spaces being heavily blanketed by CCTV cameras that capture details such as clothing, gender, age, and other personal identifiers2. The surveillance apparatus has been developed over twenty-five years and extends from urban centers like Beijing to rural villages, making it a pervasive aspect of daily life5.In particular regions such as Xinjiang, authorities have employed advanced technologies including a mobile app to conduct mass surveillance and facilitate the arbitrary detention of Muslim populations4. This level of surveillance is not limited to physical spaces; digital surveillance is also omnipresent, affecting how citizens interact online and offline6.China’s cities are equipped with more CCTV cameras than any other cities globally, and police agencies frequently use facial recognition technology to enhance their monitoring capabilities7. Despite the invasive nature of these systems, there is evidence that some citizens have developed psychological strategies to cope with constant surveillance6. Overall, this mass surveillance infrastructure represents a significant investment by the Chinese state to maintain social control and security1.",
