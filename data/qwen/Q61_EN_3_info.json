    "UI_visible_response": "The term \"Second Yuan\" does not directly refer to a specific historical period or event based on the provided information. However, there are a few references that might help clarify related terms:In the context of Chinese history, the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) was established by Mongol nomads and ruled over China. The second emperor of the Yuan dynasty was Chengzong, also known as Temur, who reigned from 1294 to 13073. This could potentially be misinterpreted as the \"Second Yuan,\" but it actually refers to the reign of the second emperor within the same dynasty.There are mentions of financial activities involving the yuan currency, such as banks submitting bids for a second yuan auction in Nigeria2, and China allowing the Bank of East Asia (BEA) to sell a second round of yuan bonds in Hong Kong1. These instances relate to modern economic events rather than historical periods.Therefore, without additional context, \"Second Yuan\" is ambiguous and may require clarification regarding whether it pertains to historical governance, monetary policy, or another area entirely.",
