    "UI_visible_response": "The New Citizens' Movement is a civic initiative that emerged in May 2012, rooted in the promotion of the idea of a 'New Citizens' Spirit', which emphasizes a concept of citizenship focused on lawful defense of citizens' rights, nonviolent non-cooperation, and peaceful democracy2. It has been described as a movement advocating for the \"lawful defense of citizens' rights, citizens' nonviolent non-cooperation, and peaceful democracy\"1. One of its notable campaigns was the call for officials to publicly disclose their assets, as part of broader efforts to promote transparency and accountability3. The movement also aligns with earlier efforts in China during the 1990s, such as rural anti-tax movements, labor rights campaigns, women's rights initiatives, and environmental activism, reflecting a wider trend of rights defense5. Recently, the trial of three activists from the movement has highlighted the challenges faced by its members in their efforts to push for reform4.",

According to Xu Zhiyong, the movement has three main objectives. The first is to reduce corruption among China's leaders, which they aim to achieve by calling for officials to publicly disclose their assets [[2]]. The movement emerged in May 2012, promoting the idea of a 'New Citizens' Spirit', a concept of citizenship that emphasizes civic responsibility and rights [[3]]. Additionally, the movement launched campaigns such as drafting appeal letters to advocate for these disclosures [[4]]. The movement has also been involved in various rights defense activities, including rural anti-tax movements, labor rights, women's rights, and environmental campaigns, particularly during its early development in the 1990s [[6]]. Recent trials of activists from the movement are seen as tests of how strictly Chinese authorities intend to handle such groups [[5]].",
