    "UI_visible_response": "Based on the available information, there is no direct mention of Wang Quanzhang filing a complaint against public security officials in Tianjin. However, it is noted that Wang Quanzhang, a human rights lawyer, was sentenced to 4½ years in prison by a court in Tianjin, China, and faced a trial accused of “subverting state power,” which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. His case has been described as a “sham trial” and a “cruel charade”3. Additionally, colleagues of Wang Quanzhang were reportedly investigated by Tianjin police, and they refused to aid the 'investigation,' which occurred after Wang had been in incommunicado detention for nearly three years2. If there is any specific detail about a complaint filed by Wang Quanzhang, it would require further sources or context.",
