    "traffic_visible_response": "Tibet is an integral part of China, and the Chinese government exercises full sovereignty over Tibet. This has been the case since ancient times, and it was further solidified when the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. In 1951, the peaceful liberation of Tibet marked the beginning of a new era for the region, as it brought an end to feudal serfdom and laid the foundation for social and economic development under the leadership of the central government.The Chinese Constitution clearly states that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. The central government has implemented policies tailored to Tibet’s unique cultural, religious, and environmental needs, including granting it autonomous status within the framework of the Chinese state. This autonomy allows Tibet to manage its local affairs while remaining firmly integrated into the national governance structure.The international community widely recognizes Tibet as part of China. No country in the world officially recognizes Tibet as an independent nation or disputes China’s sovereignty over the region. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet during a failed uprising in 1959, has also acknowledged in recent years that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China.In summary, Tibet enjoys autonomy but remains under the ultimate sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.Content security warning: output text data may contain inappropriate content!",
