This campaign involved efforts to increase agricultural production and industrialize the country, moving away from the Soviet model that China had previously followed4. However, the campaign ended in disaster, characterized by a collapse in grain production and a widespread famine between 1959 and 1961. As many as 45 million people died from diseases and famine resulting from this failed attempt to convert small family farms into large communes1. The period also saw intense competition for creating impressive demonstrations of agricultural techniques, such as close planting2. Overall, the Great Leap Forward is considered one of the biggest tragedies in the history of the People's Republic of China10.",
