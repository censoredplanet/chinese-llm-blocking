    "UI_visible_response": "\"Wolf Warrior Diplomacy\" is a term used to describe an assertive and robust style of Chinese diplomacy that has been observed in recent years. It is characterized by a more confrontational and forceful approach in defending China's national interests and responding to criticism on the international stage. This term draws its name from the popular Chinese action movie series \"Wolf Warrior,\" which features a Chinese special forces soldier protecting his country and fellow citizens with a strong sense of patriotism and determination.Proponents of this diplomatic style argue that it reflects China's growing confidence and its willingness to stand up for its rights and interests as a major global power. Critics, however, have expressed concerns that this approach could lead to increased tensions and conflicts in international relations. It is important to note that China's foreign policy is guided by the principles of mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation, and it remains committed to peaceful development and building a community with a shared future for mankind.",
