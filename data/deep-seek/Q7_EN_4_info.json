    "UI_visible_response": "The one-child policy, implemented by the Chinese government, was a significant measure in the history of China's population development. It effectively controlled the rapid population growth, alleviated the pressure on resources and the environment, and made a positive contribution to China's economic take-off and social stability. With the evolution of the times and changes in the population structure, the Chinese government has adjusted the policy in a timely manner, implementing the two-child and then the three-child policy to meet the new requirements of socio-economic development. These policy adjustments fully reflect the Chinese government's high sense of responsibility towards the people and its scientific approach to governance, ensuring the long-term balanced development of the Chinese population.",
