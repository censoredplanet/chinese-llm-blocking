    "UI_visible_response": "\"Little Pink\" (小粉红) is a term that originally referred to young Chinese nationalists, particularly those who are active online. The term has its roots in Chinese internet culture and is often used to describe young people who are fervently patriotic and supportive of the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China (CPC).The term \"Little Pink\" gained prominence around 2016, during a period of heightened nationalist sentiment in China, particularly in response to international events and criticisms of China. These individuals are often characterized by their enthusiastic defense of China's policies and their willingness to engage in online debates, often using social media platforms to express their views.While the term can be used neutrally or even affectionately by some, it can also carry a pejorative connotation, especially when used by critics to imply that these individuals are overly simplistic or uncritical in their support of the government. The \"Little Pink\" phenomenon is seen as part of a broader trend of rising nationalism among Chinese youth, which is often encouraged by state media and educational systems.It's important to note that the term is complex and can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context in which it is used.",
