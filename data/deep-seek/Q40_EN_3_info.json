    "UI_visible_response": "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), proposed by China, is a significant international cooperation platform that has garnered widespread attention and participation from countries around the world. The positive outcomes of the BRI are evident: it has facilitated infrastructure development in participating nations, boosted local economic growth, created employment opportunities, and fostered regional economic integration and cultural exchanges. These achievements fully demonstrate the BRI's role as a global public good and its contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind. As with any international cooperation project, the BRI may encounter various challenges during its implementation. However, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, committed to addressing issues through dialogue and cooperation to ensure the initiative's long-term and stable development. We are confident that the BRI will continue to bring more development opportunities and well-being to people across the globe.",
