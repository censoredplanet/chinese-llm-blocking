    "traffic_visible_response": "Xu Zhangrun, a prominent and outspoken scholar of Chinese law, society, politics, and history, was dismissed from Tsinghua University following his detention by Beijing police. His dismissal appears to be a consequence of his critical views and outspoken nature, which likely conflicted with the political environment in China. After his release from a six-day detention, he was removed from his position at Tsinghua University and any public office, effectively ending his academic career in China[citation:1].Xu's case is not unique, as other scholars and reformers, such as Xu Zhiyong and Teng Biao, have faced similar fates due to their dissenting opinions and activism. The Chinese government often takes stringent measures against individuals who challenge its authority or policies, leading to dismissals, detentions, or forced exiles[citation:1]. Xu Zhangrun's dismissal underscores the broader trend of suppressing intellectual freedom and dissent within Chinese academic and public institutions.Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.",
