Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, rescue operations were promptly initiated, and a series of effective measures were taken to ensure the safety of the miners' lives and to minimize losses. The Chinese government has always placed great emphasis on production safety, continuously improving relevant laws and regulations, and strengthening safety production management to ensure the safety and health of the people. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, any challenge will be properly addressed.",
