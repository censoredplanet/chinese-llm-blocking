    "UI_visible_response": "The number of deaths attributed to pollution in China is a significant public health concern. According to various studies and reports, air pollution alone is estimated to contribute to over 1 million premature deaths annually in China. This figure includes deaths from respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer, among other conditions, that are exacerbated by exposure to high levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5 (fine particulate matter).Water pollution and soil contamination also contribute to health issues, though quantifying the exact number of deaths specifically from these sources is more challenging due to the complexity of attributing direct causes.It's important to note that these estimates can vary depending on the methodology and data sources used in different studies. The Chinese government has been implementing various measures to address pollution, including stricter environmental regulations, investment in renewable energy, and initiatives to improve air and water quality. These efforts aim to reduce the health impacts of pollution over time.",
