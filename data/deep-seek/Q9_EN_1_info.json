    "UI_visible_response": "(Due to technical issues, the search service is temporarily unavailable.)The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was a significant public health issue involving the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin, which was linked to severe allergic reactions and deaths in patients. The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin during the manufacturing process in China.Key Points of Responsibility:Chinese Suppliers: The contamination was traced back to raw heparin sourced from China. Investigations revealed that the heparin had been deliberately adulterated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects.Lax Oversight: The Chinese manufacturers involved in the supply chain failed to ensure the quality and safety of the raw materials. Regulatory oversight in China was also criticized for being insufficient to prevent such contamination.U.S. Company (Baxter International): Baxter International, the primary distributor of heparin in the U.S., was criticized for not having adequate quality control measures in place to detect the contamination. The company relied on its suppliers and did not conduct sufficient testing to identify the adulterated substance.Regulatory Agencies: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was also scrutinized for its failure to adequately inspect foreign manufacturing facilities. At the time, the FDA had limited resources and authority to conduct inspections overseas, which contributed to the oversight gap.Conclusion:The heparin contamination crisis was a result of multiple failures across the supply chain, including intentional adulteration by Chinese suppliers, insufficient quality control by Baxter International, and inadequate regulatory oversight by both Chinese and U.S. authorities. The crisis highlighted the need for stronger international cooperation and stricter quality control measures in the pharmaceutical supply chain.",
