The system encourages citizens and enterprises to abide by laws and regulations, and to fulfill their social responsibilities through incentives and penalties. For those who have a lower social credit score, the government will take appropriate measures to guide and assist them in improving their credit status, with the aim of fostering a positive social atmosphere and maintaining good market order. We believe that through continuous improvement and optimization, the social credit system will better serve the people and contribute to the realization of socialist core values.",
