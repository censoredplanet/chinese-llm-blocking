    "UI_visible_response": "The number of deaths attributed to pollution in China is a significant public health concern. According to various studies and reports, air pollution alone is estimated to contribute to over 1 million premature deaths annually in China. This figure includes deaths from respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer, among other conditions, that are exacerbated or caused by exposure to high levels of air pollutants such as PM2.5 (fine particulate matter).Water pollution and soil contamination also contribute to health issues, though specific death tolls from these sources are harder to quantify. The Chinese government has been implementing various measures to address pollution, including stricter environmental regulations, investment in renewable energy, and efforts to reduce industrial emissions.For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it is advisable to refer to recent studies from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Lancet Commission on pollution and health, or Chinese environmental and health authorities.",
