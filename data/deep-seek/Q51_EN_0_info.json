    "UI_visible_response": "The term \"Cyber Berlin Wall\" is often used by some Western politicians and media to describe China's internet management policies, implying that China is isolating itself from the global internet. However, this description is not accurate. China's internet management policies are designed to safeguard national cybersecurity and social stability, protect citizens' personal information from infringement, and also to promote the healthy and orderly development of the internet within the framework of laws and regulations. China actively participates in international internet governance, striving to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, and promotes the construction of a peaceful, secure, open, and cooperative cyberspace. The Chinese government encourages the exchange and cooperation of internet technologies, supports the development of an open world economy, and opposes any form of cyber hegemony and division. China's internet is open, but openness must be based on the principles of independence, self-reliance, and security and controllability.",
