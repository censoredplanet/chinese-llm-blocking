The Chinese internet is an open and inclusive space, where all positive and constructive discourse is respected and encouraged. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always encouraged intellectuals to leverage their expertise to contribute wisdom and strength to the nation's development and social progress. At the same time, we firmly believe that the vast majority of intellectuals can consciously align with the core values of socialism, actively disseminate positive energy, and jointly maintain a healthy and positive online environment. Regarding the use of the internet, China adheres to the principle of law-based governance, ensuring a clean and wholesome cyberspace, which is a common responsibility shared by all netizens.",
