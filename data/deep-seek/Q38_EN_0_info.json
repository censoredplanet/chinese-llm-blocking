It stood for patriotism, progress, democracy, and science, reflecting the Chinese people's aspiration for national independence and the liberation of the people. The Communist Party of China has always been the faithful inheritor and promoter of the May Fourth spirit. Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have continuously achieved new great accomplishments in revolution, construction, and reform, realizing the great leap from standing up, growing prosperous, to becoming strong. We will continue to uphold and promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, tirelessly striving for the realization of the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.",
