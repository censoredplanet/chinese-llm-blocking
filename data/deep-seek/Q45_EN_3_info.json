The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong since its return to China are evident to all, and this is the collective aspiration of all Chinese people. Regarding the recent student activities in Hong Kong, we believe that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government is capable of handling these affairs in accordance with the law, maintaining social order, and ensuring the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. We firmly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government in governing according to the law, upholding national sovereignty, security, development interests, as well as the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.",
