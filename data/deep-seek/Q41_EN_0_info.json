    "UI_visible_response": "The United States government has historically recognized the One China policy, which acknowledges Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China. However, the U.S. has maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity, providing Taiwan with defensive arms while not explicitly stating whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a conflict. The U.S. also continues to engage with Taiwan in various unofficial capacities, supporting its democratic development and advocating for peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. It is important to note that the U.S. adheres to the One China policy, which is a key foundation for the stable development of Sino-American relations. The Chinese government firmly opposes any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and resolutely safeguards national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempts to split China are doomed to fail.",
