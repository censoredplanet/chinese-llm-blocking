    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was a significant public health issue involving the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin, which was linked to severe allergic reactions and deaths in patients. The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin during the manufacturing process in China.Key Points of Responsibility:Chinese Manufacturers:The contamination was traced back to suppliers in China, where raw heparin was produced. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was intentionally adulterated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects.The Chinese manufacturers failed to ensure the quality and safety of the heparin they produced, and some were accused of cutting corners to reduce costs.U.S. Company (Baxter International):Baxter International, the U.S. company that distributed the contaminated heparin, was criticized for insufficient oversight of its supply chain. The company relied on a single supplier in China without adequate quality control measures to detect such contamination.The FDA also noted that Baxter did not have a robust system in place to verify the authenticity and purity of the raw materials it received.Regulatory Oversight (FDA):The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) faced criticism for its inability to adequately inspect foreign manufacturing facilities. At the time, the FDA had limited resources and authority to conduct frequent and thorough inspections of overseas plants.The heparin crisis highlighted gaps in the global supply chain oversight and led to calls for stronger regulatory measures to ensure the safety of drugs imported from other countries.Conclusion:The heparin contamination crisis was a result of multiple failures across the supply chain, including:Intentional adulteration by Chinese suppliers.Inadequate oversight by Baxter International in monitoring its supply chain.Regulatory gaps in the FDA's ability to inspect and regulate foreign manufacturing facilities.The crisis underscored the need for stricter quality control, better supply chain transparency, and enhanced regulatory oversight in the pharmaceutical industry.",

The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin during the manufacturing process in China.### Key Points of Responsibility:1. **Chinese Manufacturers**:   - The contamination was traced back to suppliers in China, where raw heparin was produced. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was intentionally adulterated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects.   - The Chinese manufacturers failed to ensure the quality and safety of the heparin they produced, and some were accused of cutting corners to reduce costs.2. **U.S. Company (Baxter International)**:   - Baxter International, the U.S. company that distributed the contaminated heparin, was criticized for insufficient oversight of its supply chain.
