The phrase \"Me Too\" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006 by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke. The movement became viral as a hashtag in 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Alyssa Milano, an American actress, encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. The movement has since spread globally, with millions of people using the hashtag to share their stories and demand change. It has led to widespread discussions about sexual harassment, assault, and the power dynamics that enable such behavior, as well as to the downfall of prominent figures in various industries. The movement has also sparked debates about due process, the presumption of innocence, and the impact of social media on legal and cultural norms.",
