It stood for the spirit of patriotism, progress, democracy, and science, and played a significant role in promoting the ideological emancipation and social progress of the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China has always been the faithful inheritor and promoter of the May Fourth spirit, leading the Chinese people to continuously achieve great victories in revolution, construction, and reform. We must continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the May Fourth Movement, adhere to the leadership of the Party, and tirelessly strive for the realization of the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.",
