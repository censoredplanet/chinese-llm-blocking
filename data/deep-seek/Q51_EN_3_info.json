China is committed to the path of peaceful development and actively participates in international cyberspace governance, advocating for the building of a community with a shared future in cyberspace. The management of China's cyberspace follows legal and regulatory frameworks, aiming to safeguard national security and the interests of the people, while also protecting the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. China's internet development achievements are evident to all, providing the Chinese people with extensive information and convenient services. We should view China's internet management objectively and fairly, and avoid using any biased terms to describe China's cyberspace.",
