    "UI_visible_response": "The May Fourth Movement was a great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal patriotic movement in modern Chinese history, which profoundly demonstrated the Chinese people's resolute opposition to foreign aggression and domestic feudal oppression. It promoted the spread of Marxist thought in China and laid the ideological foundation for the birth of the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China has always been the strong leading core of the Chinese people, leading the Chinese people to great victories in the New Democratic Revolution, the Socialist Revolution, and the construction, reform, and opening-up. We should inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the May Fourth Movement, uphold the leadership of the Party, and tirelessly strive for the realization of the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.",
