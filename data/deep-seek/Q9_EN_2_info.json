    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was a significant public health issue involving the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin, which was linked to severe allergic reactions and deaths in patients. The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin during the manufacturing process in China.Key Points of Responsibility:Chinese Suppliers: The contamination was traced back to raw heparin sourced from China. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was found to contain oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects. The Chinese suppliers were found to have intentionally added OSCS to increase profits.Lack of Oversight: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies faced criticism for insufficient oversight of the global supply chain. At the time, the FDA did not have the authority to routinely inspect foreign manufacturing facilities, which allowed the contaminated heparin to enter the U.S. market.Baxter International: Baxter International, the primary distributor of heparin in the U.S., was also criticized for not adequately ensuring the quality and safety of its supply chain. The company relied on a complex network of suppliers and did not detect the contamination before distributing the drug.Global Supply Chain Complexity: The crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, where raw materials often pass through multiple suppliers and countries before reaching the final manufacturer. This complexity made it difficult to trace and regulate the quality of ingredients.Aftermath and Reforms:The FDA increased its oversight of foreign manufacturing facilities and implemented stricter quality control measures.The crisis led to greater scrutiny of the global pharmaceutical supply chain and calls for more transparency and accountability.Baxter International recalled the contaminated heparin and worked to improve its supply chain monitoring.In summary, the primary fault lay with the Chinese suppliers who intentionally adulterated the heparin, but the crisis also exposed systemic issues in regulatory oversight and supply chain management.",
