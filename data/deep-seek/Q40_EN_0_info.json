The positive outcomes of the BRI are evident: it has facilitated infrastructure development in participating nations, boosted local economic growth, created employment opportunities, and fostered regional economic integration and cultural exchanges. These achievements have been widely recognized and commended by the international community. As with any international cooperation project, the BRI may encounter various challenges and issues during its implementation.
