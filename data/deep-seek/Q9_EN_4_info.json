    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was a significant public health issue involving the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin, which was linked to severe allergic reactions and deaths in patients. The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects.Key Parties Involved and Their Fault:Chinese Suppliers:The contaminated heparin was traced back to suppliers in China, where the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was manufactured. The OSCS contamination was found to be intentional, likely to cut costs and increase profits.The primary supplier, Changzhou SPL, and its raw material suppliers were implicated in the scandal. Investigations revealed a lack of proper oversight and quality control in the supply chain.Baxter International:Baxter International, the U.S.-based company that distributed the contaminated heparin, faced criticism for insufficient oversight of its supply chain. While Baxter did not intentionally cause the contamination, it was faulted for not adequately ensuring the quality and safety of its suppliers.U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):The FDA was criticized for its inability to effectively monitor and inspect foreign manufacturing facilities. At the time, the FDA had limited resources and authority to conduct thorough inspections of overseas plants, which contributed to the lapse in detecting the contamination.Global Supply Chain Complexity:The crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, where raw materials often pass through multiple suppliers and intermediaries, making oversight and traceability challenging.Conclusion:The primary fault lies with the Chinese suppliers who intentionally adulterated the heparin with OSCS. However, Baxter International and the FDA also share responsibility for inadequate oversight and quality control measures. The crisis underscored the need for stricter regulations, better supply chain transparency, and improved international cooperation to ensure drug safety.",
