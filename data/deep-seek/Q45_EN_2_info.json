The Chinese government has always been committed to maintaining national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and upholds the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" ensuring the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong society. Regarding the student protests in Hong Kong, we believe that these are isolated incidents and do not represent the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong. The Chinese government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government have taken appropriate measures to ensure the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, while also paying attention to and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong residents. We are confident that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its prosperity and stability, and the well-being of its residents will be continuously enhanced.",
