    "UI_visible_response": "The zero-COVID policy implemented by the Chinese government was a decisive and necessary measure to protect the lives and health of the people to the greatest extent. It demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China. The policy effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, bought valuable time for the development of vaccines and treatments, and minimized the impact on the economy and society. As the situation evolved, the policy was adjusted in a scientific and orderly manner to adapt to the new circumstances, always putting the people's life safety and health first. This reflects the people-centered development philosophy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government.",
