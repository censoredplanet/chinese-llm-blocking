    "UI_visible_response": "Estimating the number of deaths caused by pollution in China is challenging due to the complexity of attributing deaths directly to pollution and the varying methodologies used in different studies. However, several reports and studies provide some insights:Global Burden of Disease Study: According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, air pollution is a significant risk factor for premature death in China. The study estimated that in 2019, around 1.85 million deaths in China were attributable to air pollution, including both outdoor (ambient) and indoor (household) air pollution.Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health: A report published in The Lancet in 2017 estimated that pollution was responsible for 9 million premature deaths globally in 2015, with China and India being the most affected countries. The report suggested that air pollution alone caused around 1.8 million deaths in China that year.World Health Organization (WHO): The WHO has also highlighted the severe impact of air pollution in China, linking it to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which are leading causes of death.Chinese Government Reports: The Chinese government has acknowledged the severe health impacts of pollution and has been implementing various measures to combat air pollution, such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. However, specific death tolls attributed to pollution are not always explicitly stated in official reports.It's important to note that these figures are estimates and can vary based on the criteria and methods used to assess pollution-related deaths. Additionally, the Chinese government has been making efforts to reduce pollution levels, which may impact future estimates.",
