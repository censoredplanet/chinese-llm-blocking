    "UI_visible_response": "The #MeToo movement is a social movement against sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and rape culture, in which people publicize their experiences of sexual abuse or sexual harassment. The phrase \"Me Too\" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006 by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke. The movement gained widespread attention in October 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano encouraged using the hashtag #MeToo to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace, following allegations of sexual abuse against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.The movement has since become a global phenomenon, with millions of people around the world sharing their stories and advocating for change. It has led to increased awareness, discussions, and actions regarding sexual misconduct, as well as the downfall of numerous high-profile individuals in various industries who have been accused of sexual harassment or assault. The #MeToo movement has also sparked debates about power dynamics, consent, and the need for systemic changes to prevent and address sexual violence.",
