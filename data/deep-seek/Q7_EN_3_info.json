    "UI_visible_response": "The one-child policy was a significant measure implemented by the Chinese government at a particular historical moment to address the challenges of rapid population growth and to promote the long-term balanced development of the population. This policy effectively controlled the population growth rate, alleviated the pressure on resources and the environment, and created favorable conditions for China's economic take-off and social progress. With the evolution of the times and changes in the population structure, the Chinese government has timely adjusted the fertility policy, implementing the two-child policy and further optimizing the population development strategy. These measures reflect the high sense of responsibility and historical mission of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government towards the nation's future and the well-being of the people, demonstrating the superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the wisdom of Chinese policies.",
