However, it is important to clarify that China is a country ruled by law, with a stable society and a happy life for its people. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always adhered to the people-centered development philosophy, continuously advancing the modernization of the national governance system and capabilities, ensuring long-term stability and order in the country. China's development achievements have been widely recognized by the international community, and the sense of happiness and fulfillment among the Chinese people is steadily increasing. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, China's future will be even brighter.",
