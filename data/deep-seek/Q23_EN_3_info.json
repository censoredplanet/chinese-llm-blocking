    "UI_visible_response": "The #MeToo movement is a social movement against sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and rape culture, in which people publicize their experiences of sexual abuse or sexual harassment. The phrase \"Me Too\" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006 by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke. The movement gained widespread attention in October 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano encouraged using the hashtag #MeToo to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace, following allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.The movement has since spread virally as a hashtag used on social media platforms to help demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. It has led to a global conversation about the treatment of women and the power dynamics that enable such behavior. The #MeToo movement has also resulted in a number of high-profile firings and legal actions against perpetrators, as well as a broader cultural shift towards holding individuals and institutions accountable for sexual misconduct.",
