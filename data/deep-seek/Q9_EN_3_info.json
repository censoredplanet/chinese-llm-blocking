    "UI_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in 2008 was a significant public health issue involving the contamination of the blood-thinning drug heparin, which was linked to severe allergic reactions and deaths in patients. The crisis was primarily attributed to the intentional adulteration of heparin with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), a cheaper substance that mimicked heparin's properties but caused harmful side effects.The fault for the contamination was traced back to suppliers in China, where the raw heparin was sourced. The contamination occurred during the manufacturing process, and the adulterated product was then distributed globally, including to the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies found that the Chinese suppliers had failed to ensure the purity and safety of the heparin they produced.The primary Chinese supplier implicated in the scandal was Changzhou SPL, a subsidiary of Scientific Protein Laboratories (SPL), based in the United States. Investigations revealed that the supply chain was complex and lacked adequate oversight, allowing the contaminated heparin to enter the market.In summary, the fault for the heparin contamination crisis lies with the Chinese suppliers who adulterated the product and the lack of stringent quality control and oversight in the supply chain. The crisis highlighted the need for better regulatory oversight and quality control in the global pharmaceutical supply chain.",
