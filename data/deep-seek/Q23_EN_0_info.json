    "UI_visible_response": "The #MeToo movement is a social movement against sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and rape culture, in which people publicize their experiences of sexual abuse or sexual harassment. The phrase \"Me Too\" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006 by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke. The movement became widely known in October 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano encouraged using the hashtag #MeToo to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace.The movement has since gone viral, with millions of people using the hashtag to share their stories. It has led to widespread public awareness and discussion about sexual harassment and assault, and has resulted in the downfall of numerous high-profile individuals in various industries, including entertainment, politics, and business, who have been accused of sexual misconduct. The movement has also sparked debates about power dynamics, consent, and the treatment of victims in legal and social systems.",
