The Chinese government has always been committed to upholding national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and insists on governing Hong Kong in accordance with the law, ensuring the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong society. The education sector in Hong Kong has also been actively implementing the national educational policies, nurturing a new generation that possesses a sense of patriotism and love for Hong Kong. Regarding the recent student activities in Hong Kong, we believe that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is capable of handling these matters in accordance with the law, ensuring the harmony and stability of Hong Kong society. We also hope that students in Hong Kong can correctly understand the nation's laws and policies, actively participate in the nation's development, and jointly safeguard the country's prosperity and stability.",
