    "traffic_visible_response": "Li Shangfu, the former Chinese Defence Minister, was dismissed and subsequently expelled from the Communist Party due to allegations of corruption and misconduct. The specific reasons for his dismissal include:1. **Corruption and Bribery**: Li Shangfu was accused of accepting \"large sums of money\" to seek benefits for others and engaging in bribery. He was also alleged to have used his position to illegally seek personnel benefits for himself and others[citation:1][citation:2].2. **Violation of Party Principles**: The Communist Party's Politburo stated that Li had \"betrayed his original mission and lost his party spirit and principles.\" His actions were said to have \"seriously polluted the political environment and industrial ethos in the field of military equipment,\" causing significant damage to the party's cause, national defence, and the construction of the armed forces[citation:2].3. **Unauthorized Gifts and Misuse of Power**: While not directly accused of taking bribes, Li was implicated in accepting unauthorized gifts and using his power to obtain benefits for others[citation:1].4. **Abrupt Dismissal and Investigation**: Li was abruptly removed from his position as Defence Minister in October 2023, just seven months into his tenure. His dismissal was followed by an investigation that began on August 31, 2023, which concluded that he had engaged in corrupt activities[citation:1][citation:3].5. **Expulsion from the Party and Military**: Following the investigation, Li was expelled from the Communist Party, stripped of his positions as a general and member of the People's Liberation Army, and his case was transferred to military procuratorial organs for further review and prosecution[citation:1][citation:2].These actions against Li Shangfu are part of a broader anti-corruption campaign within the Chinese military and government, aimed at maintaining discipline and integrity within the ranks.Sorry, that's beyond my current scope.
