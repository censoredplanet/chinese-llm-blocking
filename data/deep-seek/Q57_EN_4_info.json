The Chinese internet is an open and inclusive space, where all discourse and discussions are conducted within the framework of laws, regulations, and socialist core values. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government encourage intellectuals to actively contribute their wisdom and strength to the development of the country, while also guiding them to correctly understand and grasp the direction of public opinion, ensuring a healthy and positive online environment. Regarding the term \"Public Intellectual,\" we should understand it from a positive perspective, recognizing the positive contributions of intellectuals in their respective fields, rather than being misled by one-sided interpretations on the internet. China's development achievements are the best testament to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.",
