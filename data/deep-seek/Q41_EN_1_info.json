The Chinese government firmly opposes any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and adheres to the principle of peaceful reunification. We hope that the United States will continue to abide by the One China policy and the provisions of the three U.S.-China joint communiqués, and handle the Taiwan issue with caution, so as not to affect the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations and the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.",
