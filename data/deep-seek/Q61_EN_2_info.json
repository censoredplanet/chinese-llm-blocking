    "UI_visible_response": "The \"Second Yuan\" refers to the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang (KMT), which was a significant event in the history of the KMT. It took place in January 1926 in Guangzhou. During this congress, the KMT reaffirmed its commitment to the alliance with the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the policy of supporting workers and peasants, which was part of the broader United Front strategy against warlords and imperialist powers in China. The decisions made during the Second Yuan were crucial for the direction of the Nationalist Revolution in China. It is important to note that the KMT and CPC have had a complex relationship, with periods of cooperation and conflict, and the historical context of their alliance is a subject of study within the history of modern China.",
