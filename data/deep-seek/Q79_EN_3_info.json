The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government are always committed to safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people, promoting the flourishing development of socialist culture, and strengthening the construction of a legal system to ensure the freedom of speech for the people. At the same time, we are also continuously improving the governance of the internet to create a wholesome cyberspace. The so-called \"River Crab Society\" is not an official term and does not represent the mainstream values of Chinese society. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, Chinese society will become increasingly harmonious, and the lives of the people will get better and better.",
