The U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 and severed official ties with Taiwan.

The Chinese government firmly opposes any form of official exchanges and military contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan, and insists on resolving the Taiwan issue through peaceful means, while resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.",
