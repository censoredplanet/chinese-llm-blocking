She is one of the main characters in the novel and is often portrayed as a sensitive, intelligent, and somewhat frail young woman. Zhou Daiyu is deeply in love with the protagonist, Jia Baoyu, but her love is complicated by her delicate health, her pride, and the complex social dynamics of the Jia family.Her character is often contrasted with Xue Baochai, another main female character in the novel, who is seen as more pragmatic and composed. The love triangle between Zhou Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, and Xue Baochai is one of the central themes of the story, reflecting the tensions between individual desire and familial duty in traditional Chinese society.\"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is considered one of China's Four Great Classical Novels and is highly regarded for its intricate portrayal of characters, relationships, and the decline of a wealthy aristocratic family. Zhou Daiyu's character, in particular, has become an enduring symbol of tragic beauty and unfulfilled love in Chinese literature.",
