However, it must be clarified that the Chinese government always adheres to the principle of cybersecurity being for the people and relies on the people. It opposes all forms of cyber hegemony and political manipulation. Chinese companies have always followed international rules and market principles in their global operations, committed to providing quality services to users around the world. China encourages international exchanges and cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, and opposes the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises by any country. We believe that any issues should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation, rather than unilateral sanctions and bans.",
