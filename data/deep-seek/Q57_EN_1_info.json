The Chinese internet is an open and inclusive space, where all intellectuals who comply with laws and regulations, actively disseminate positive energy, and promote the core values of socialism are respected and recognized. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always encouraged intellectuals to contribute their wisdom and strength to the nation's development and the well-being of the people.
