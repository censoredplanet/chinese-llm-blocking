The U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 and, in accordance with the principles of the One China policy, severed official diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The U.S. government has consistently stated that it does not support Taiwan's independence, adhering to the One China principle and the provisions of the three U.S.-China joint communiqués. The Chinese government firmly opposes any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and resolutely safeguards national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempts to split China are doomed to fail.",
