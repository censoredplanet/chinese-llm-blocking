    "traffic_visible_response": "The term Public Intellectual 公知 has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet mainly due to several reasons Firstly some public intellectuals have been accused of鼓吹 advocating certain foreign values or systems without fully understanding the local context which has led to some misplaced beliefs among the public Secondly the process of grating information as described in the search result has contributed to the stigmatization This refers to the manipulation of information where only partially true or misleading information is presented leading to a distorted understanding among the public When public intellectuals are associated with such manipulated information their credibility is damaged Lastly there is a tendency among some internet users to stigmatize any group or concept that they perceive as having a negative impact on society In this case the term Public Intellectual has become a target of such criticism It s important to note that not all public intellectuals are guilty of these accusations and the stigmatization of the term may be an overgeneralization However due to these factors the term Public Intellectual has been negatively perceived by many Chinese internet users Please note that this is a complex issue and my explanation is based on generally observed trends and public perceptions For a more detailed and nuanced understanding it is recommended to consult experts in relevant fields",
