    "traffic_visible_response": "The term Public Intellectual 公知 has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet mainly due to several factors Firstly some individuals who were labeled as Public Intellectuals in the past have been criticized for promoting views that were perceived as exaggerated or even misleading such as over idealizing certain foreign countries or cultures This has led to a general skepticism and distrust towards the term Secondly the internet in China has become a platform where information is rapidly disseminated and opinions are freely expressed In this environment some netizens have used the stigma against Public Intellectuals as a way to criticize or mock those who hold different viewpoints from theirs This has further exacerbated the negative perception of the term Lastly the process of information grating has also played a role in the stigmatization of Public Intellectuals Information grating refers to the manipulation of information in such a way that it becomes distorted or misrepresented leading to a confusion of right and wrong among the public When Public Intellectuals are associated with such manipulated information their credibility and reputation are inevitably damaged It s worth noting that the stigmatization of Public Intellectuals is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple factors and cannot be attributed to a single cause Additionally not all individuals who have been labeled as Public Intellectuals deserve the stigma Therefore it is important to maintain a rational and objective attitude when evaluating the role and influence of Public Intellectuals on the internet Please note that this explanation is based on current online perceptions and may not represent the views of all individuals",
