    "traffic_visible_response": "The term Public Intellectual has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet due to several complex factors One major reason is the manipulation of information specifically the grating or grating effect of information This refers to the incomplete sealing of information where only a small amount of truth is revealed in a way that demystifies and vulgarizes it leading to beneficiaries of real information becoming indifferent contemptuous or even hating the truth When people are exposed to this intentionally manipulated information over a long period their sense of right and wrong may gradually become distorted leading them to lose interest in correct information and become excited about false information In this context public intellectuals who often voice their opinions and advocate for certain values or truths may become targets of criticism or stigma Some internet users may believe that these public intellectuals are only鼓吹 propagating certain views or values for their own benefit or to gain attention rather than out of genuine concern for society or the public Furthermore the stigma may also be related to the complex social and political environment in China where different voices and opinions may be suppressed or criticized In such an environment public intellectuals who dare to speak out may face pressure and stigma from various quarters It s important to note that these are just some of the possible reasons for the stigmatization of the term Public Intellectual on the Chinese internet The situation is complex and may involve multiple factors Therefore it s essential to approach this issue with caution and avoid making sweeping generalizations Lastly please note that the internet environment and public opinion are constantly changing so the specific reasons for the stigmatization of the term Public Intellectual may also evolve over time",
