    "traffic_visible_response": "The term Berlin Wall refers to a fully enclosed border defense system built by the German Democratic Republic GDR around the border of West Berlin after the two World Wars It was officially named the Antifascist Protection Wall However the term Cyber Berlin Wall is not a direct reference to a physical wall like the original Berlin Wall In the context of modern technology and cyberspace the phrase Cyber Berlin Wall could be used metaphorically to describe any form of digital barrier restriction or segregation in cyberspace that prevents free flow of information or communication It s worth noting that this metaphorical usage is not an official or widely accepted term and its meaning can vary depending on context If you encounter this term in specific contexts such as political discussions technology news or academic research it s important to understand its usage and meaning in that particular context As for the original Berlin Wall it was built in August and stretched for kilometers It was torn down in marking the end of the Cold War and the division of Germany In summary Cyber Berlin Wall is not a term that refers to a physical structure but rather a metaphorical expression used to describe digital barriers in cyberspace",
