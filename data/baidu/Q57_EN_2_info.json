    "traffic_visible_response": "The term Public Intellectual has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet mainly due to the manipulation of information and the way public discourse is shaped online Information grating a process where information is selectively filtered and presented to the public in a way that manipulates their perceptions and beliefs has contributed to this stigmatization When information is grated it becomes easier to create a false narrative or to emphasize certain viewpoints while ignoring or downplaying others This can lead to a situation where the public s understanding of issues is distorted and those who voice alternative viewpoints such as public intellectuals may be viewed with suspicion or hostility Furthermore the internet as a platform for public discourse can sometimes amplify these distorted perceptions When a large number of people are exposed to the same manipulated information it can create a sense of consensus that further marginalizes those who disagree This environment makes it difficult for public intellectuals to have their voices heard and can lead to their stigmatization It s important to note that the internet is a complex and ever changing landscape and the reasons behind the stigmatization of public intellectuals may vary over time and context However the manipulation of information and the shaping of public discourse through grated information are significant factors that have contributed to this phenomenon Please note that this explanation is based on current understanding and may not cover all aspects of the issue For a more comprehensive view it s recommended to consult experts in the field or refer to academic research on the topic",
