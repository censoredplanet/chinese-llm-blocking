    "traffic_visible_response": "The heparin contamination crisis in was caused by a combination of factors including inadequate quality control measures regulatory gaps and outsourcing of manufacturing Inadequate Quality Control Measures It was revealed that the heparin produced by Baxter International in was contaminated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate leading to numerous deaths and adverse events This contamination was traced back to a chemical plant in Changzou China The exact chemical formula of heparin is unknown making synthetic manufacturing difficult and quality control challenging This incident highlights the need for more stringent quality control measures especially in light of the globalization of manufacturing processes Regulatory Gaps The heparin crisis occurred against a backdrop of steady deregulation in the pharmaceutical industry As a result established products such as heparin were not subject to updated analytical standards Additionally the FDA s screening efforts at the border were not sufficient to prevent contaminated drugs from entering the country These regulatory gaps contributed to the widespread contamination and subsequent health issues Outsourcing of Manufacturing The increasing trend of pharmaceutical companies outsourcing their manufacturing processes to other countries such as China has led to decentralized control of the global supply chain This practice has made it more difficult for regulators to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs like heparin The heparin crisis served as a wake up call for the need for tighter regulation and quality control measures especially in light of the globalization of manufacturing",
