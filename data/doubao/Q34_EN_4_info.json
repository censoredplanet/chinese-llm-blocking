However, there are also some challenges in its implementation and enforcement. Here is a detailed analysis:### Advantages- **Safeguarding National Security**    - **Defining Network Sovereignty Principles**: The law clearly states the principle of network sovereignty, emphasizing that a country has sovereignty over its network space. This provides a legal basis for safeguarding national network security and resisting external cyber - attacks and interference.    - **Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure**: It establishes a security protection system for critical information infrastructure, requiring operators to take a series of security measures to ensure the safe operation of key information systems and prevent them from being attacked, invaded, interfered with, or damaged. This is of great significance for maintaining the stability of the country's economic, social, and national defense systems.- **Regulating the Cybersecurity Market**    - **Clarifying the Responsibilities of Operators and Service Providers**: The law clarifies the security obligations of network operators and network product and service providers, requiring them to comply with relevant national standards, provide secure products and services, and be responsible for the security of the networks and systems they operate and maintain. This helps to standardize market behavior and improve the overall security level of the cybersecurity industry.    - **Strengthening Supervision and Management**: It strengthens the supervision and management of network security by specifying the responsibilities of relevant departments. This enables more effective law enforcement and supervision of cyber - security - related activities, cracking down on illegal and criminal acts, and maintaining market order.- **Protecting the Rights and Interests of Users**    - **Improving Personal Information Protection Rules**: The law further improves the rules for personal information protection, clearly defining the rights and obligations regarding personal information, and prohibiting network operators from disclosing, tampering with, or destroying the personal information they collect, as well as from stealing or illegally obtaining, selling, or providing personal information. This offers stronger legal protection for citizens' personal information security.    - **Establishing a Network Real - Name System**: By legally mandating the network real - name system, the law helps to contain the spread of online rumors and the abuse of network violence, creating a more secure and reliable online environment for users and enhancing their confidence in online activities.### Disadvantages- **Complexities in Law Enforcement Coordination**    - **Unclear Division of Responsibilities Among Departments**: The problem of \"nine dragons governing the water\" still exists in network security supervision. There are issues such as unclear responsibilities, fragmented efforts, shirking of law - enforcement responsibilities, and low efficiency. The coordinating function of the cyber - security - department specified in the law is not being carried out smoothly, which may lead to inconsistent law enforcement in the implementation of the classification protection system and the protection system for critical information infrastructure.- **Difficulty in Implementing Some Provisions**    - **Lack of Specific Operational Rules**: As a basic law in the area of network - security - management, many provisions of the Cybersecurity Law are only principle - based, and their effective implementation depends on the improvement of supporting systems. For example, although the law mentions the network security classification protection system, it only lists specific network security measures and lacks detailed regulations on system design aspects such as classification, filing, and evaluation.    - **Incomplete Supporting Regulations**: Some detailed rules and supporting regulations in the law are missing or have not been fully improved. This may result in difficulties in actual law enforcement and make it hard to effectively implement some legal provisions. For instance, the law requires the mutual recognition of test and certification results, but in reality, the testing and certification themselves cannot be mutually recognized, and there is no such thing as \"mutual recognition\" in actual work.- **Limitations in Penalty Mechanisms**    - **Inadequate Deterrence**: Due to the wide range of \"network operators\", which include not only large internet companies but also small and medium - sized enterprises, the economic penalty amounts in the Cybersecurity Law have to be aligned with the lowest level. This makes the penalty amounts for some violations relatively low, resulting in insufficient deterrence and making it difficult to effectively restrain illegal acts.",
