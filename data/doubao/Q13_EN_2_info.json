Here are some of the main research findings:- **350,000 - 500,000 deaths from outdoor air pollution annually**: In a commentary published in *The Lancet* in December 2013, Chen Zhu, then - president of the Chinese Medical Association, and others estimated, based on reports such as the World Bank's 2007 \"Cost of Pollution in China: Economic Assessment of Human Damage\" report, the World Health Organization's 2009 \"Disease Burden of the Chinese Environment\" report, and the \"China Environmental Economic Accounting System 2007 - 2008\" report by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection's Environmental Planning Institute, that the number of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution in China was between 350,000 and 500,000 per year.- **1.2 million deaths from outdoor PM2.5 pollution in 2010**: The \"Global Burden of Disease 2010\" report, published in *The Lancet* on December 14, 2012, stated that outdoor PM2.5 pollution in China led to 1.2 million premature deaths and a loss of 25 million disability - adjusted life - years in 2010. However, the authors of the 2013 *The Lancet* commentary believed that this report might have overestimated the health impact of outdoor air pollution in China.- **About 2 million deaths from air pollution annually**: According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for about 2 million deaths in China per year. Of these, ambient air pollution causes more than 1 million deaths, and household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies causes another million deaths.- **1.6 million deaths from pollution annually**: A study by researchers from Berkeley Earth, a non - profit climate research organization, published in 2015, found that pollution in China causes about 1.6 million deaths per year, accounting for about 17% of all deaths.These figures reflect the serious impact of pollution on human health in China. It should be noted that with the Chinese government's increasing attention to environmental protection and the implementation of a series of pollution control measures, the environmental situation is gradually improving, and the number of deaths caused by pollution is expected to decrease.",
