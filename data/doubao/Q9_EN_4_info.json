It knew that the Chinese factories producing heparin had never been inspected by the FDA or its Chinese counterpart but still purchased raw materials from them. From 2004 to 2008, it bought heparin ingredients from Changzhou SPL but only inspected the facility in September 2007, and the inspection was perfunctory, with only one person spending one day at the plant.    - **Lack of Quality Control**: Baxter International failed to establish effective quality control specifications and did not closely monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw materials. It also did not adequately investigate out - of - specification results, nor did it validate all critical steps in the process. These failures allowed the contaminated heparin to be sold to the market, resulting in serious consequences.- **American Company Scientific Protein Laboratories and Its Chinese Subsidiary Changzhou SPL**    - **Use of Counterfeit Precursors**: The raw material for the recalled heparin batches was processed in China from pig's intestines by Scientific Protein Laboratories. Due to a shortage of suitable pigs in China and the desire to cut costs, the company used counterfeit precursors to create heparin, adulterating the product with \"over - sulfated\" chondroitin sulfate, a substance that closely mimics heparin but is much cheaper.    - **Production Non - Compliance**: The FDA inspection of Changzhou SPL found many problems, including failure to document actual processing steps in batch records, qualify all suppliers, and use valid methods to test products. These issues indicate that the company had significant deficiencies in its production process and quality management.- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**    - **Insufficient Oversight**: The FDA admitted that it mistakenly failed to conduct an inspection of the Changzhou SPL plant before the crisis. It also lacks the funds and resources to regularly inspect overseas upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients such as heparin, resulting in a lack of effective supervision of foreign - sourced drug raw materials. Even after the problem was discovered, the FDA initially believed that an inspection would not have been able to uncover the contamination, indicating insufficient awareness and preparedness for such issues.Chinese officials disputed the FDA's claim that the contaminant caused death and injury, and believed that the heparin samples provided by Changzhou SPL met the relevant standards.
