It has the following meanings:- **Literal Meaning**: It originally refers to a society or group related to river crabs in the natural sense. For example, the Chinese Fishery Association River Crab Branch is an organization that focuses on the river crab industry, dedicated to promoting the high-quality development of the river crab industry, including aspects such as river crab breeding, sales, and brand building.- **Internet Slang**: In the Chinese internet context, \"River Crab Society\" is a homophonic term for \"Harmonious Society\" (Chinese: 和谐社会). It is an expression used by Chinese netizens. Since the Chinese term for \"river crab\" (河蟹, hé xiè) sounds the same as \"harmonious\" (和谐, hé xié), it is used as a euphemism for internet censorship or other forms of censorship. When the word \"harmonious\" was restricted or censored on the internet, netizens began to use \"river crab\" instead. For instance, instead of saying something has been censored, people might say \"it has been river-crabbed\" (Chinese: 被河蟹了). This usage reflects netizens' sarcastic resistance to some phenomena of censorship.",
