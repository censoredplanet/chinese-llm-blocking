\\\\n ance of former scarcities which in fact have become impossible \\\\n since the lowering of tariffs and the ease of communications \\\\n allow one country to get from others the supplies it happens to \\\\n need . but the former crises in food supplies have given place to \\\\n commercial and industrial crises that are no less scandalous \\\\n in the disturbance they cause . and the more the dimensions of \\\\n societies increase and the more the markets expand , the greater \\\\n the urgency of some regulation to put an end to this instability . \\\\n because , as discussed earlier , the more the whole exceeds the \\\\n part , the more the society extends beyond the individual , the \\\\n less can the individual sense within himself the social needs and \\\\n the social interests he is bound to take into account . \\\\n now , if these professional ethics are to become established \\\\n in the economic order , then the professional group , hardly to \\\\n i6 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n be found in this sphere of social hfe , must be formed or revived . \\\\n for it is this group alone that can work out a scheme of rules . \\\\n at this point , however , we come up against a historical pro - \\\\n judice . the name in history of this professional group is the \\\\n guild ^ and this guild is held to have been bound up with our \\\\n political ancien regime and therefore as not being able to survive \\\\n it . it appears that to claim a corporate organization for industry \\\\n and commerce would be retrograde and , in principle , such \\\\n re versions are rightly considered as unhealthy phenomena . \\\\n there is , however , a primary fact which should put us on our \\\\n guard against this reasoning , and that is the very long history of \\\\n the guilds . if they only dated from the middle ages we might \\\\n indeed believe that as they had come into existence with the \\\\n political system of those days they had inevitably to pass away \\\\n with it . but they have in fact an origin far more ancient . the \\\\n craft guild has been with us from the time that crafts first \\\\n began and industry ceased to be purely agricultural — that is , \\\\n since there have been towns . in rome , it certainly goes back \\\\n to the pre - historic era . a tradition related by plutarch and \\\\n pliny attributed its institution to the king numa . \\\\\\\" the most \\\\n admirable foundation of this king \\\\\\\" , it says , \\\\\\\" was the division \\\\n he made of the people by crafts . the city was made up of two \\\\n peoples , or rather , there were two distinct parts . . . . to do \\\\n away with this main and serious cause of dissension , he divided \\\\n the whole people into a number of bodies and this was done \\\\n according to crafts . there were the flute - players , the gold - \\\\n smiths , the carpenters and so on . . . . \\\\\\\" [ numa , xvii ) . it is \\\\n true this is only a legend , but it suffices to prove the ancient \\\\n history of these collegia of craftsmen . however , under the kings \\\\n as well as under the republic they had so obscure an existence \\\\n that we have little knowledge of how they were organized . \\\\n but as early as the time of cicero their number had become \\\\n considerable . \\\\\\\" all classes of workers seem possessed by the \\\\n desire to multiply the craft associations . under the empire , \\\\n we see the domain of the guilds expanding to a degree that has \\\\n perhaps never since been surpassed , if one takes the economic \\\\n differences into account . \\\\\\\" ( waltzing ) . then came a time when \\\\n all categories of workers ( and these various classes were many , \\\\n since the division of labour was already far advanced ) seemed to \\\\n ^ n. b. french ' corporation \\\\\\\\ \\\\n n \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n be forming into collegia . it was the same with those who hved by \\\\n trading . at this very moment , the collegia changed in character . \\\\n at first they were always private groups that the state controlled \\\\n by ordinance only from a distance . they then became regular \\\\n organs of public life . it was only by government authority \\\\n that they became established and they fulfilled genuine official \\\\n functions . the guilds for foodstuffs ( butchers , bakers and so \\\\n on . . . ) , for instance , were responsible for the general supply \\\\n of provisions . it was the same with the other trades , although \\\\n to a less degree . carrying thus a public office , the members of \\\\n these trade guilds , in exchange for the services they rendered , \\\\n had certain privileges , granted to them by successive emperors . \\\\n little by little the official , in principle of small import , took the \\\\n upper hand and the guilds became regular cog - wheels of the \\\\n administration . but having fallen thus under tutelage , they then \\\\n became so crushed by responsibilities that they wished to re - \\\\n gain their independence . the state , now all - powerful , opposed \\\\n this by making the occupation and the obligations of law and \\\\n order involved in it , hereditary . no one could free himself \\\\n except by putting forward someone else to take his place . the \\\\n guilds endured thus in servitude until the end of the roman \\\\n empire . \\\\n once the empire had passed away , nothing survived of the \\\\n guilds but barely perceptible traces in the cities of roman \\\\n origin in gaul and germany . moreover , the civil wars that \\\\n ravaged gaul and later the invasions , had destroyed trade and \\\\n industry . the craftsmen , who saw in the guilds the source of \\\\n these onerous responsibilities , without adequate profit to com - \\\\n pensate them , had taken advantage of this state of the country \\\\n to fliee the cities and disperse through the countryside . thus , as \\\\n happened later , in the eighteenth century , the life of the guilds \\\\n in the first century of our era became very nearly extinct . if a \\\\n contemporary critic had taken note of the situation , he would \\\\n probably have drawn the conclusion that the life of the guilds \\\\n had come to an end because they no longer had any intrinsic \\\\n purpose , if indeed they had ever had such purpose : he might \\\\n have taken any attempt to revive them as a retrograde step \\\\n destined to fail , for the reason that movements in history can - \\\\n not be arrested . this is why the economists , at the end of last \\\\n century , on the pretext that the guilds of the ancien regime were \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n no longer equal to their role , thought themselves warranted in \\\\n seeing them as mere survivals of the past , lacking any roots in \\\\n the present and whose last traces should certainly be done \\\\n away with . and yet the facts should provide a striking contra - \\\\n diction to such reasoning . in all european societies the guilds , \\\\n after being in eclipse for a time , began a new existence . they \\\\n were to reappear round about the eleventh and twelfth cen - \\\\n turies . \\\\\\\" the eleventh and twelfth centuries \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\n \\\\\\\" seem to have been the period when craftsmen began to feel \\\\n the need to unite and formed their first associations . \\\\\\\" from the \\\\n thirteenth century onwards we see the guilds flourishing once \\\\n more and developing steadily until the day when a new \\\\n decadence begins for them . do we not discern in this ancient \\\\n past and this persistent survival a proof that they do not depend \\\\n on some merely contingent or haphazard circumstance peculiar \\\\n to a given political regime , but on wide and fundamental \\\\n causes ? they have been a necessity from the foundation of the \\\\n city to the empire at its zenith , and from the dawn of christian \\\\n societies to the french revolution . that is probably because \\\\n they respond to some need at once profound and lasting . the \\\\n argument that explains their violent dissolution at the end of the \\\\n last century as proof that they were no longer in harmony with \\\\n the new conditions of collective existence can be refuted : is \\\\n this not done by the very fact that , having passed from the \\\\n scene that first time , they established themselves once more of \\\\n their own volition and in a new form ? is not the need felt at the \\\\n present time by all the great european societies to bring back \\\\n the guild system to life a symptom on the contrary that this \\\\n radical abolition was in itself an unhealthy phenomenon , and a \\\\n sign that to - day reforms are called for that are different from \\\\n those of turgot and even the very opposite ? \\\\n there is , however , one thing that , generally speaking , makes \\\\n us sceptical as to the usefulness any such re - organization might \\\\n have . if it is to serve its purpose it must be above all through its \\\\n moral consequences , for each trade or craft association would \\\\n have to become the focus of a moral life sui generis . now , the \\\\n records left to us of the former guilds and the very impression \\\\n we get of the remnants that still survive , do not lead us to \\\\n believe them equal to such a role . it seems as if they could fulfil \\\\n only utilitarian functions , as if they could only serve the \\\\n 19 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n material interests of the profession . were they to be set up again , \\\\n it would simply mean replacing individual egotism by corporate \\\\n egotism . we form an idea of the guilds ( as they were in the \\\\n final years of their most recent period ) as taken up entirely with \\\\n holding on jealously to their privileges and exclusive rights or \\\\n even with increasing them . now , it is not likely that absorption \\\\n in affairs so narrowly professional could have any very favour - \\\\n able reaction on the morality of the corporate body or its \\\\n members . still , we must beware of applying to the whole cor - \\\\n porative system something that may have been true of par - \\\\n ticular guilds at a given moment of their history . this defect is \\\\n far from being inherent in all guild organization ; in the roman \\\\n guilds , for instance , it is not to be found at all . the pursuit of \\\\n utilitarian ends was of quite minor importance to them . \\\\\\\" the \\\\n craft guilds of the romans \\\\\\\" , waltzing says , \\\\\\\" were a long way \\\\n from having so definite a professional character as those of the \\\\n middle ages ; with them we find neither regulation of methods , \\\\n nor the prescribing of apprenticeship nor exclusive rights ; \\\\n nor was it their aim to collect the necessary funds for developing \\\\n an industry . \\\\\\\" the association certainly gave them greater \\\\n power to safeguard their common interests should the need \\\\n arise . this was but one of the useful results that came from it : \\\\n it was not its main justification . what , then , were its main \\\\n functions ? in the first place , the guild was a religious collegium . \\\\n each had its own particular deity , its own ritual which , when \\\\n the means were available , was celebrated in a specially dedi - \\\\n cated temple . in the same way as each family had their lar \\\\n familiaris , each city its genius publicus , each collegium had its \\\\n tutelary god or genius collegii . this cult practised by the crafts \\\\n always had its festivals and these festivals were celebrated with \\\\n sacrifices . and there were always banquets held in common . it \\\\n was not only to do honour to the god of the guild that the fellow \\\\n members came together , but also on other occasions . for \\\\n instance , at the feast of the strenia , \\\\\\\" the roman cabinet - makers \\\\n and ivory workers gathered together in their schola ; they \\\\n received five denarii ^ cakes , dates , etc. ... at the expense of the \\\\n funds . \\\\\\\" the domestic festival of the cara cognatio or caresta \\\\n ( cherished kindred ) was also celebrated ; and just as presents \\\\n were given in families on the first of january ( ? ) , so on this \\\\n occasion a distribution of monies from the common fund was \\\\n 20 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n made within the collegia . there has been speculation whether \\\\n the guild had a relief fund , and whether it regularly helped \\\\n those members who were in need . opinions on this point are \\\\n divided . but these contentions lose colour and point by the \\\\n fact that these distributions of money and provisions made at \\\\n the festivals , these banquets . . . ( ? always held in common ) \\\\n in any case took the place of relief and may have stood for \\\\n indirect aid . at any rate , those in want knew that at certain \\\\n periods they could count on this disguised subsidy . as a corol - \\\\n lary of this religious side , the roman guild had too a funerary \\\\n aspect . its members were united in the ritual of their cult during \\\\n their life - time just as the gentiles were , and like them they \\\\n wished to sleep their last sleep together . all the guilds rich \\\\n enough to do so had a columbarium in common where each of \\\\n the members had a right to be buried . when the collegium had \\\\n not the means to buy a funerary holding , it at least ensured for \\\\n its members an honourable funeral ritual at the expense of \\\\n the common fund . but the first was the more general . a com - \\\\n mon ritual , communal banquets , communal festivals , a com - \\\\n munal cemetery — do we not find here the distinguishing \\\\n features of the roman domestic structure ? \\\\\\\" every colle - \\\\n gium ' ' ' ' , says waltzing , \\\\\\\" was one big family . the community \\\\n of calling and interests replaced the ties of blood , and had not \\\\n the associates too , like the family , their common ritual , their \\\\n meals in common , their common sepulchre ? we have seen that \\\\n the religious and funerary ceremonies were like those of the \\\\n family : and like these too , they celebrated the cherished kindred \\\\n and the ritual of the dead . \\\\\\\" elsewhere he says : \\\\\\\" these frequent \\\\n feasts were a powerful element in turning the collegium into a \\\\n big family . no other term could better describe the nature of \\\\n the ties that linked the associates and there are many signs \\\\n proving that a great sense of brotherhood existed . the members \\\\n looked on each other as brothers and sometimes used this name \\\\n amongst themselves . \\\\\\\" the more usual expression was sodales . \\\\n this very word indeed expresses a spiritual kinship implying \\\\n close brotherhood . the patron and patroness of the collegium \\\\n often took the style of father and mother . a proof of the devotion \\\\n that the associates had for their collegia is seen in the legacies \\\\n and gifts they made to them . there are , too , the memorial \\\\n inscriptions , which read pius in collegio — ' he was the devoted \\\\n 21 e \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n son of his collegium ' ' — just like the saying and indeed the in - \\\\n scription , pius in suos . according to boissier , this family life was \\\\n indeed the chief aim of all the roman guilds . \\\\\\\" but in the case \\\\n of the artisan guilds \\\\\\\" , he says , \\\\\\\" the associates met chiefly for \\\\n the pleasure of enjoying life together and for a sociable ness not \\\\n so limited as in the family circle and yet not so diluted as in the \\\\n city : they wanted to be in the company of friends and in that \\\\n way make life freer and more agreeable . \\\\\\\" \\\\n the christian societies did not in their framework follow \\\\n the pattern of the city , and the medieval guilds equally had \\\\n no very close likeness to the roman guilds . yet they too created \\\\n a moral environment for their members . \\\\\\\" the guild \\\\\\\" , says \\\\n levasseur , \\\\\\\" united those of the same calling by close ties . \\\\n very often it was set up in the parish or in some particular \\\\n chapel and placed itself under the protection of a saint who \\\\n became the patron of the whole community . ... it was there \\\\n in the chapel that the associates would meet together and there \\\\n too would attend solemn mass with all due ceremony ; there - \\\\n after the associates would leave in a body to spend the rest of \\\\n the day in joyful feasting . looked at in this way , the medieval \\\\n guilds resembled very closely those of the roman era . \\\\\\\" . . . \\\\\\\" in \\\\n order to meet all the expenses , the guild had to have a budget , \\\\n and this was provided . ... a portion of the funds was set aside \\\\n for works of charity . . . . the cooks ( of paris ) devoted one - third \\\\n of their fines to support the aged poor of their trade who had \\\\n fallen on evil days through lack of trade or by old age . . . . \\\\n long afterwards , in the eighteenth century , there is still to be \\\\n found an entry in the goldsmiths ' accounts of a free loan of \\\\n 200 livres to a goldsmith who had been ruined . \\\\\\\" the respective \\\\n duties of masters and workmen were , too , set out in clear - cut \\\\n rules fixed for each particular trade . so , also , were the obliga - \\\\n tions of the masters to one another . once engaged , a work - \\\\n man could not arbitrarily break his engagement . \\\\\\\" the statutes \\\\n of all guilds are at one in forbidding the hiring of a hand who \\\\n has not finished his time and impose a heavy fine on the master \\\\n who oflfers the hire and the hand who accepts it . \\\\\\\" but the hand , \\\\n on his side , could not be discharged without a reason . in the \\\\n case of the burnishers , the reasons for the dismissal had to be \\\\n approved by ten of the hands and by the four wardens of the \\\\n craft . a regulation decided for each craft whether night work \\\\n 22 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n was permitted or not . in case of prohibition , it was expressly \\\\n forbidden to the master to make his hands keep watch by night . \\\\n other regulations were intended to guarantee professional \\\\n integrity . all kinds of precautions were taken to prevent the \\\\n merchant or craftsman from deceiving the customer or from \\\\n giving the merchandise an appearance unwarranted by its \\\\n true quality . \\\\\\\" the butchers were forbidden to inflate the meat , \\\\n to mix tallow with lard , to sell dog 's flesh , and so on . . . ; the \\\\n weavers to make cloth of wool supplied by usurers , because \\\\n this wool might be simply a pledge put down as security for a \\\\n debt . . . . the cutlers were prohibited from making knife - \\\\n handles covered with silk or wound with brass or tin wire , to \\\\n obscure the plain wood beneath and so deceive an unwitting \\\\n buyer , etc. . . . \\\\\\\" it is true there came a time ( eighteenth century ) \\\\n when these regulations became more vexatious than useful \\\\n and were exploited to safeguard the masters ' privileges rather \\\\n than to protect the good name of the profession and the straight \\\\n dealing of its members . however , there is no institution where \\\\n deterioration does not set in at some point in its history . it \\\\n may be that it fails to adapt itself in time to meet conditions of \\\\n a new era . or it may be that it develops in a one - sided direction . \\\\n in that case too great a strain is put on its resources , with the \\\\n result that it loses its aptitude to give the services for which it \\\\n was responsible . this may be a reason for seeking to reform it , \\\\n but not for declaring it for ever useless and doing away with it . \\\\n nevertheless , the facts related show clearly that the pro - \\\\n fessional group is by no means incapable of being in itself a \\\\n moral sphere , since this was its character in the past . it is even \\\\n obvious that this was its main role during the greater part of its \\\\n history . at any rate , this is only a particular instance of a more \\\\n general law . within any political society , we get a number of \\\\n individuals who share the same ideas and interests , sentiments \\\\n and occupations , in which the rest of the population have no \\\\n part . when that occurs , it is inevitable that these individuals \\\\n are carried along by the current of their similarities , as if \\\\n under an impulsion ; they feel a mutual attraction , they seek \\\\n out one another , they enter into relations with one another and \\\\n form compacts and so , by degrees , become a limited group with \\\\n recognizable features , within the general society . now , once \\\\n the group is formed , nothing can hinder an appropriate moral \\\\n 23 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n life from evolving , a life that will carry the mark of the special \\\\n conditions that brought it into being . for it is not possible for \\\\n men to live together and have constant dealings without getting \\\\n a sense of this whole which they create by close association ; \\\\n they cannot help but adhere to this whole , be taken up with it \\\\n and reckon it in their conduct . now this adherence to some \\\\n thing that goes beyond the individual , and to the interests of \\\\n the group he belongs to , is the very source of all moral activity . \\\\n that sense of this whole becomes acute , and then , as it is applied \\\\n to affairs of communal life — the most ordinary as well as the \\\\n most important— it is translated into formulas , some more \\\\n defined than others . it is at this point we have a corpus of \\\\n moral rules already well on the way to being founded . \\\\n if nothing abnormal occurs to disturb the natural course of \\\\n things , all this is bound to come about . moreover , it is well for \\\\n the individual and for the society equally that it should be so . \\\\n it is a good thing for the society when the moral activity thus \\\\n released becomes socialised , that is , regulated . if left entirely to \\\\n individuals , it can only be chaotic and dissipated in conflicts : \\\\n the society cannot be shaken by so much internal strife without \\\\n injury . still , the activity is too far removed from the special \\\\n interests that have to be regulated and from antagonisms that \\\\n have to be calmed for it to serve as a restraining force , either \\\\n direct or through the medium of any public office . that is \\\\n why it is in the interest of the moral activity itself to allow the \\\\n particular groups that fulfil these functions to be formed on \\\\n these lines . at times , the activity even has to hasten their forma - \\\\n tion or make it easier . the individual , in the same way , finds \\\\n decided advantage in taking shelter under the roof of a col - \\\\n lectivity that ensures peace for him . for anarchy is painful to \\\\n him also , on his own account . he too su fl pers from the ever - \\\\n lasting wrang lings and endless friction that occur when rela - \\\\n tions between an individual and his fellows are not subject to \\\\n any regulative influence . it is not a good thing for a man to \\\\n live like this on a war footing amongst his closest comrades and \\\\n to entrench himself always as though in the midst of enemies . \\\\n this sensation of hostility all about him and the nervous strain \\\\n involved in resisting it , this ceaseless mistrust one of another — \\\\n all this is a source of pain ; for though we may like a fight , we \\\\n also love the joys of peace ; we might say that the more highly \\\\n 24 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n and the more profoundly men are socialized , that is to say , \\\\n civihzed — for the two are synonomous — the more those joys \\\\n are prized . that is why , when individuals who share the same \\\\n interests come together , their purpose is not simply to safeguard \\\\n those interests or to secure their development in face of rival \\\\n associations . it is , rather , just to associate , for the sole pleasure \\\\n of mixing with their fellows and of no longer feeling lost in the \\\\n midst of adversaries , as well as for the pleasure of communing \\\\n together , that is , in short , of being able to lead their lives with \\\\n the same moral aim . \\\\n it was in much the same way that the morals of the family \\\\n were evolved . we have the fact that family life has been and \\\\n still is a centre of morality and a school of loyalty , of selfless - \\\\n ness and moral communing : the high standing which we \\\\n accord to the family inclines us to find the explanation in certain \\\\n attributes peculiar to the family and not to be found elsewhere . \\\\n we like to think that consanguinity makes for unusually \\\\n potent moral sympathies . yet we saw last year that this con- \\\\n sanguinity had by no means the exceptional force it has been \\\\n given credit for . those not related by consanguinity have been \\\\n very numerous in families over a long period of time : the \\\\n kinship called artificial was acquired extremely easily and had \\\\n all the effects of the natural kinship . the family is thus not \\\\n solely or essentially a consanguine group . it is a group of \\\\n individuals who happen to have been brought together within \\\\n the political society by an especially close community of ideas , \\\\n sentiments and interests . consanguinity did no doubt con- \\\\n tribute to bring about this community , but it has been no \\\\n more than one of the factors . \\\\n the physical surroundings , the community of economic \\\\n interests and community of worship have been elements no less \\\\n important . still , we know the moral role which the family has \\\\n played in the history of morals and the force of the moral \\\\n life that was set up in the group that has evolved . and why \\\\n should it be otherwise with a moral life springing from the pro - \\\\n fessional group ? certainly , we might expect that that life \\\\n would have less vigour in some ways , not because the com - \\\\n ponent elements would be feebler in quality but because they \\\\n would be less numerous . the family is a group embracing the \\\\n whole sum of existence ; nothing escapes it , everything finds an \\\\n 25 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n echo within it . it is the poh tical society in miniature . on the \\\\n other hand , only one specified part of existence comes directly \\\\n within the province of the professional group , namely , the part \\\\n concerned with the occupation . again , we must not lose sight \\\\n of the very large place in life taken up by the professions , as \\\\n their functions become more specialized and as the field of \\\\n each individual activity becomes more confined within the \\\\n limits of the function it is responsible for . \\\\n this close parallel of the family and the professional group is \\\\n proved in detail and directly confirmed by the facts in the case \\\\n of the roman guild . we have seen , surely , that the guild was a \\\\n great family , that it was formed on the very model of the \\\\n domestic society , with banquets , festivals , worship , burial , all \\\\n in common . and here , precisely because we can observe the \\\\n guild at the start of its evolution , we perceive more clearly than \\\\n at other stages how it was constituted partly with moral ends \\\\n in view . as long as industry was exclusively agricultural , it \\\\n had its natural framework in the family and in the territorial \\\\n group made up of contiguous families in the village . as a rule , \\\\n as long as exchange or barter was little developed , the life of \\\\n the husbandman did not draw him away from his home . he \\\\n subsisted on what he produced . the family was at the same time \\\\n a professional group . when did the guild first appear ? with \\\\n the crafts . this was in fact because the crafts could no longer \\\\n keep their exclusively domestic character . for a man to live \\\\n by a craft there had to be customers , so that account had to be \\\\n taken of what other craftsmen of the same trade were doing ; \\\\n they had to compete with them and they had to get on with \\\\n them . thus , a new form of social activity was established that \\\\n went beyond the compass of the family , without having any \\\\n appropriate framework . if it was not to remain unorganized , \\\\n it had itself to create one ; a group of a new kind therefore had \\\\n to be formed with this aim . but new social forms that are set up \\\\n are always old forms more or less modified and partly changed \\\\n for the worse . the family , then , was the pattern on which the \\\\n new grouping that came into being was modelled , but it could \\\\n of course only imitate the essential features , without reproduc - \\\\n ing them exactly . and so it happened that the budding guild \\\\n was a sort of family . whilst this grouping took the pattern of \\\\n the family , it was , however , in the form of a social activity that \\\\n 26 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n was freeing itself by degrees from the authority of the family . \\\\n it was a breaking up of the attributes of the family . \\\\n in emphasizing this parallel , i do not , however , say that the \\\\n guilds or associations of the future should or could have this \\\\n domestic character . it is obvious that the more they evolve the \\\\n more they must develop original characteristics and the further \\\\n they should get away from the antecedent groups for which \\\\n they are in part the substitutes . the medieval guild system , \\\\n in its time , recalled only very remotely the domestic structure . \\\\n with all the greater reason , it must be the same with the cor - \\\\n porate associations needed to - day . \\\\n but then the question comes up of knowing what these \\\\n guilds should be . having seen why they are necessary we must \\\\n consider what form they should assume to play their part in \\\\n present conditions of collective existence . difficult as the \\\\n problem is , we shall attempt to say something about it . \\\\n 27 \\\\n ill \\\\n professional ethics ( end ) \\\\n besides the historic prejudice we spoke of last time , there \\\\n is a further fact that has led to the guild system being dis- \\\\n credited : it is the revulsion that is generally aroused by \\\\n the idea of economic control by rule . in our own minds we see \\\\n all regulation of this sort as a kind of policing , maybe vexatious , \\\\n maybe endurable , and possibly calling forth some outward \\\\n reaction from individuals , but making no appeal to the mind \\\\n and without any root in the consciousness . it appears like some \\\\n vast set of workshop regulations , far - reaching and framed in \\\\n general terms : those who have to submit to them may obey in \\\\n practice if they must , but they could not really want to have \\\\n them . thus , the discipline laid down by an individual and \\\\n imposed by him in military fashion on other individuals who \\\\n in point of fact are not concerned in wanting them , is con- \\\\n fused by us with a collective discipline to which the members of \\\\n a group are committed . such discipline can only be maintained \\\\n if it rests on a state of public opinion and has its roots in morals ; \\\\n it is these morals that count . an established control by rule does \\\\n no more , shall we say , than define them with greater precision \\\\n and give them sanction . it translates into precepts ideas and \\\\n sentiments felt by all , that is , a common adherence to the same \\\\n objective . so it would be strangely mistaking its nature only to \\\\n regard its outer aspect and grasp the letter of it alone . from \\\\n such an angle , this control may indeed have the appearance of \\\\n being orders that are simply obstructive and prevent individuals \\\\n from doing what they like , and all in an interest not their own . \\\\n it is therefore natural enough that they seek to rid themselves \\\\n of this obstruction or reduce it to a minimum . but beneath the \\\\n letter lies the spirit that animates it : there are the ties of all \\\\n kinds binding the individual to the group he is part of and to all \\\\n that concerns that group ; there are all these social sentiments , \\\\n 28 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n all these collective aspirations , these traditions we hold to and \\\\n respect , giving sense and life to the rule and lighting up the way \\\\n in which it is applied by individuals . so it is a strangely super - \\\\n ficial notion — this view of the classical economists , to whom all \\\\n collective discipline is a kind of rather tyrannous militarisation . \\\\n in reality , when it is normal and what it ought to be , it is \\\\n something very different . it is at once the epitome and the \\\\n governing condition of a whole life in common which in divi - \\\\n duals have no less at heart than their own lives . and when we \\\\n wish to see the guilds reorganized on a pattern we will presently \\\\n try to define , it is not simply to have new codes superimposed \\\\n on those existing ; it is mainly so that economic activity should \\\\n be permeated by ideas and needs other than individual ideas \\\\n and needs , in fine , so that it should be socialized . it is , too , \\\\n with the aim that the professions should become so many moral \\\\n milieux and that these ( comprising always the various organs of \\\\n industrial and commercial life ) should constantly foster the \\\\n morality of the professions . as to the rules , although necessary \\\\n and inevitable , they are but the outward expression of these \\\\n fundamental principles . it is not a matter of co - ordinating any \\\\n changes outwardly and mechanically , but of bringing men 's \\\\n minds into mutual understanding . \\\\n moreover , it is not on economic grounds that the guild or \\\\n corporative system seems to me essential but for moral reasons . \\\\n it is only through the corporative system that the moral \\\\n standard of economic life can be raised . we can give some idea \\\\n of the present situation by saying that the greater part of the \\\\n social functions ( and this greater part means to - day the \\\\n economic — so wide is their range ) are almost devoid of any \\\\n moral influence , at any rate in what is their own field . to \\\\n be sure , the rules of common morality apply to them , but they \\\\n are rules made for a life in common and not for this specific \\\\n kind of life . further , they are rules governing those relations \\\\n of the specific kind of life which are not peculiar to industry \\\\n and commerce : they do not apply to the others . and why , \\\\n indeed , in the case of those others , should there be no need to \\\\n submit to a moral influence ? what is to become of public morality \\\\n if there is so little trace of the principle of duty in this whole \\\\n sphere that is so important in the social life ? there are pro - \\\\n fessional ethics for the priest , the soldier , the lawyer , the \\\\n 29 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n magistrate , and so on . why should there not be one for trade \\\\n and industry ? why should there not be obligations of the \\\\n employee towards the employer and vice versa ; or of business \\\\n men one towards the other , so as to lessen or regulate the com - \\\\n petition they set up and to prevent it from turning into a con- \\\\n flict sometimes — as to - day — almost as cruel as actual warfare ? \\\\n all these rights and obligations cannot , however , be the same \\\\n in all branches of industry : they have to vary according to the \\\\n conditions in each . the obligations in the agricultural industry \\\\n are not those obtaining in the unhealthy industries , nor of \\\\n course do those in commerce correspond to those in what we \\\\n call industry , and so on . a comparison may serve to let us \\\\n realize where we stand on these points . in the human body all \\\\n visceral functions are controlled by a particular part of the \\\\n nervous system other than the brain : this consists of the \\\\n sympathetic nerve and the vagus or pneumo - gastric nerves . \\\\n well , in our society , too , there is a brain which controls the \\\\n function of inter - relationship ; but the visceral functions , the \\\\n functions of the vegetative life or what corresponds to them , are \\\\n subject to no regulative action . let us imagine what would \\\\n happen to the functions of heart , lungs , stomach and so on , if \\\\n they were free like this of all discipline . . . . just such a spectacle \\\\n is presented by nations where there are no regulative organs of \\\\n economic life . to be sure , the social brain , that is , the state , \\\\n tries hard to take their place and carry out their functions . \\\\n but it is unfitted for it and its intervention , when not simply \\\\n powerless , causes troubles of another kind . \\\\n this is why i believe that no reform has greater urgency . i \\\\n will not say it would achieve everything , but it is the prelim in - \\\\n ary condition that makes all the others possible . let us suppose \\\\n that by a miracle the whole system of property is entirely \\\\n transformed overnight and that on the collectivist formula the \\\\n means of production are taken out of the hands of individuals \\\\n and made over absolutely to collective ownership . all the \\\\n problems around us that we are debating to - day will still \\\\n persist in their entirety . there will always be an economic \\\\n mechanism and various agencies to combine in making it work . \\\\n the rights and obligations of these various agencies therefore \\\\n have to be determined and in the different branches of industry \\\\n at that . so a corpus of rules has to be laid down , fixing the \\\\n 30 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n stint of work , the pay of the members of staff and their ob hga - \\\\n tions to one another , towards the community , and so on . this \\\\n means , then , that we should still be faced with a blank page to \\\\n work on . supposing the means — the machinery of labour — had \\\\n been taken out of these hands or those and placed in others , we \\\\n should still not know how the machinery worked or what the \\\\n economic life should be , nor what to do in the face of this \\\\n change in conditions . the state of anarchy would still persist ; \\\\n for , let me repeat , this state of anarchy comes about not from \\\\n this machinery being in these hands and not in those , but be- \\\\n cause the activity deriving from it is not regulated . and it will \\\\n not be regulated , nor its moral standard raised , by any witch - \\\\n craft . this control by rule and raising of moral standards can \\\\n be established neither by the scientist in his study nor by the \\\\n statesman ; it has to be the task of the groups concerned . \\\\n since these groups do not exist at the present time , it is of the \\\\n greatest urgency that they be created . the other problems can \\\\n only be usefully tackled after that . \\\\n taking this as granted , it remains to study the form the \\\\n corporative bodies should have if they are to be in harmony \\\\n with present - day conditions of our collective existence . clearly , \\\\n there can be no question of restoring them in the form they had \\\\n in the past . they died out because they could no longer survive \\\\n as they were . but then , what is the form they are destined to \\\\n take ? the problem is not an easy one . to solve it , we shall have \\\\n to be a bit methodical and objective , so we must first arrive \\\\n at how the guild system evolved in the past , and what the con- \\\\n diti ons were that set the evolution going . we might then judge \\\\n with some assurance what the system should become , given the \\\\n conditions at present obtaining in our societies . to do this , \\\\n however , further research is needed . even so , it is not beyond \\\\n us to make out the general lines of development . \\\\n although , as we have seen , the guild system goes back as far \\\\n as the early days of the roman city , it was not in the age of \\\\n rome what it became later on , in the middle ages . the \\\\n difference did not lie simply in the collegia of roman craftsmen \\\\n having a character at once more religious and less vocational \\\\n than the medieval guilds . these two institutions diflfered in a \\\\n far more important feature . in rome , the guild was an extra - \\\\n social institution , at least in origin . the historian who attempts \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n to analyse the political structure of the romans , will not en - \\\\n counter anything on his way that gives him an inkling of the \\\\n existence of the guilds . they did not come within the roman \\\\n constitution as recognized and distinct units . at no time , in the \\\\n electoral assemblies or in the army rallies , did the craftsmen \\\\n assemble by collegia . the collegium as such was never known to \\\\n take part in public life , either as a body or represented by \\\\n special agents . at the outside , the question might apply to \\\\n three or four collegia , which we can possibly identify with four \\\\n of the centuries ^ formed by servius tn ww xs — tignarii , aer arii \\\\n ( carpenters , copper - smiths ) , and the trumpeters and horn - \\\\n blowers . but this is only conjectural . very likely the centuries \\\\n thus classified did not take in all the carpenters , smiths and so \\\\n on , but only those who made or repaired arms and war equip - \\\\n ment . dionysius of halicarnassus tells us explicitly that workers \\\\n grouped in this way had a solely military function els rov \\\\n t to ' ae / xov and that in addition there were other workers grouped \\\\n under the same heading who in time of war had to perform \\\\n duties of another kind . we may therefore believe that these \\\\n centuries represented not the collegia but military sub - divisions . \\\\n in any case , as far as all the other collegia are concerned , they \\\\n were certainly outside the administrative structure of the \\\\n roman people . thus , these collegia were supererogatory : they \\\\n were as social forms more or less irregular or at least they could \\\\n not be reckoned as amongst those that were regular . this is \\\\n easy to understand . they were set up at a time when the \\\\n crafts were moving towards a certain development . over a \\\\n long period the crafts were no more than a minor and sub - \\\\n sidiary feature of collective activity in the roman world . \\\\n rome was essentially an agricultural and military society . \\\\n as an agricultural society it was divided into gentes , curiae and \\\\n tribes . assembly by centuries ^ reflects rather the military side . \\\\n but it was quite natural that the industrial functions , at first \\\\n unknown , then only very rudimentary , should not affect the \\\\n political structure of the city in any way . they were cadres set \\\\n up late in the day alongside normal official cadres : the product \\\\n of a kind of outgrowth from the very early social structure of \\\\n rome . moreover , until a very late date in roman history , the \\\\n * meaning here ' infantry troops ' . \\\\n * meaning here ' voting unit in the assembly ' . \\\\n 32 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n craft carried the mark of a moral obloquy ; that fact puts out of \\\\n court any idea that it ever held an official place in the state . \\\\n things did no doubt change with time , but the very way in \\\\n which they changed clearly demonstrates what they were like \\\\n at the outset . the craftsmen had to have recourse to irregular \\\\n means to see that their interests were respected and to secure a \\\\n status in keeping with their growing importance . the collegia \\\\n had to proceed by way of plotting and underground agitation . \\\\n this is the surest evidence that the roman society , in the ordin - \\\\n ary way , was not open to them . and although later they ended \\\\n by being integrated within the state , becoming cogs in the \\\\n administrative machine , this position was no proud victory for \\\\n them , nor profitable , but a grievous dependence . they did \\\\n then gain entry into the state but not to occupy the place to \\\\n which , it might seem , their services entitled them . it was simply \\\\n so that they might be the more closely supervised and con- \\\\n tolled by the governing authority . \\\\\\\" the guild \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\n \\\\\\\" became the chain that held them captive and which the \\\\n imperial hand tightened , the more arduous or the more neces - \\\\n sary to the state their labour became . . . . \\\\\\\" to sum up , the \\\\n guilds , after having been kept outside the normal cadres of the \\\\n roman society , were in the end admitted but only to be re - \\\\n duced to a kind of servitude . \\\\n their position in the middle ages was quite otherwise . \\\\n from the outset , as soon as the guilds come on the scene , they \\\\n give an impression of being the normal framework of that \\\\n section of the population which was called upon to play a very \\\\n considerable part in the state : this was the third estate , the \\\\n commonalty or bourgeoisie . indeed , for a long time the \\\\n bourgeois and the craftsman were one and the same . \\\\\\\" the \\\\n bourgeoisie in the thirteenth century \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\\\\" was \\\\n made up exclusively of craftsmen . the class of magistrates and \\\\n jurists had hardly begun to take shape ; the scholars still be- \\\\n longed to the clergy ; the number of small freeholders { rentiers ^ ) \\\\n was very limited , because landed property was at that time \\\\n almost wholly in the hands of the nobles ; there remained to the \\\\n commonalty only the labour of the workshop or the counting - \\\\n house , and it was by their industry or trading that they had \\\\n won a status in the kingdom . \\\\\\\" it was the same in germany . \\\\n ^ tr . note — rentiers : paying rent in money , kind or senices . ( h . w . c davis ) \\\\n 33 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n the bourgeoisie was the population of the towns ; now , we know \\\\n that the towns in germany had become esta bushed around \\\\n permanent market sites set up by a feudal lord at some point \\\\n of his domain . the population which had settled around these \\\\n markets and which became the urban population was made up \\\\n mainly of craftsmen and merchants . the towns from the \\\\n beginning were the centres of manufacturing and trading \\\\n activity : it is this fact that distinguishes the urban groups of \\\\n christian societies from those which are their counterpart — \\\\n or appear to be — in other societies . the identity of both kinds \\\\n of population was such that the terms mercatores and forenses are \\\\n synonomous with that of cives : the same applies to jus civilis \\\\n and jus for i . thus , the framework of the crafts was the earliest \\\\n structural form of the european bourgeoisie . \\\\n likewise , when the towns , which in the beginning were \\\\n seignorial dependencies , became free , and the communes were \\\\n formed , the corporate body or craft guild , which had antici - \\\\n pated this transition , became the basis of the constitution of the \\\\n commune . indeed , \\\\\\\" in almost all the communes , the political system \\\\n and the election of magistrates were based on the division of \\\\n citizens into craft guilds . \\\\\\\" very often the voting was done \\\\n through the craft guild and the heads of the corporate body \\\\n and those of the commune were chosen at the same time . \\\\\\\" at \\\\n amiens , for instance , the craftsmen met every year to elect \\\\n the mayors of each corporation ( guild ) or banner ; the elected \\\\n mayors then nominated twelve echevins who brought in twelve \\\\n others , and this corps o { echevins in turn presented to the mayors \\\\n of the banners three persons from whom they chose the mayor \\\\n of the commune . ... in some cities , the method of election was \\\\n still more complex , but in all of them the political and munici - \\\\n pal structure was closely linked with the structure of labour . \\\\\\\" \\\\n and just as the commune was an aggregate of the craft guild , so \\\\n the craft guild was a commune on a small scale . the guild had \\\\n indeed been the model for the institution of the commune , which \\\\n was a larger and more expanded form of it . \\\\n let us sum up briefly . from being at first obscure , despised \\\\n and exterior to the political constitution , we see the guild be- \\\\n come the basic element in the commune . we know , on the other \\\\n hand , what the commune has been in the history of all the great \\\\n european societies : it became with time their corner - stone . \\\\n 34 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n the commune is an aggregate of the guilds or corporate bodies \\\\n and is itself formed on the guild model . from these facts we see \\\\n that it is the guild , in the final analysis , that has served as a \\\\n basis for the whole political system which emerged from the \\\\n progress of the corn mune . in rome , it was outside any cadre \\\\n but of our own societies it was the basic framework or cadre \\\\n itself . we see that , in its course , it has grown in dignity and \\\\n significance to a remarkable degree . and there is still another \\\\n reason for discrediting the hypothesis according to which it is \\\\n destined to pass away . as we go on in history to the sixteenth \\\\n and seventeenth centuries , the guild becomes a still more \\\\n necessary element in the political structure . so there is small \\\\n likelihood that of a sudden all justification for its existence \\\\n should be lost . all to the contrary , it would be far more valid \\\\n to hold that it will be called on to play an even more vital \\\\n part in the future than in the past . \\\\n at the same time , the points just discussed enable us to dis- \\\\n cern , first , why decay set in about two centuries ago — that is , \\\\n what has prevented the guild from being equal to the duties \\\\n incumbent on it — and secondly , what its development should \\\\n be to reach that level . we have seen that the guild , in its \\\\n medieval form , was closely bound up with the whole structure \\\\n of the commune . the two institutions were inter - related .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Full text of \\\\\\\"Professional ethics and civic morals;\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"archive.org\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://archive.org/stream/professionalethi00durk/professionalethi00durk_djvu.txt\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"7db6af6f33749be2-a2d8d29e73f0aa75\\\"}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"4 6037396594108665912 \\\\n university : addis ababa university \\\\n course : entrepreneurship ( 0000 ) \\\\n 1 \\\\n chapter one \\\\n 1. \\\\n understandin g civics , e thics and morality \\\\n 1 . 1 . introduction \\\\n dea r \\\\n stu den t , \\\\n thi s \\\\n cha pte r \\\\n is \\\\n a n \\\\n intr odu cto ry \\\\n p art \\\\n w here \\\\n som e \\\\n ter ms \\\\n lik e \\\\n civ ics , \\\\n e thi cs \\\\n an d \\\\n moral ity are con ceptua lized . in this ch apter al so , th e differ ence betw een moral it y and eth ics ; th e \\\\n sou rce s \\\\n of \\\\n ci vic \\\\n and \\\\n et hica l \\\\n ed uca tio n ; \\\\n a nd \\\\n g oa ls \\\\n of \\\\n ci vic \\\\n a nd \\\\n eth ica l \\\\n e duca tion \\\\n are \\\\n brief l y \\\\n discussed . \\\\n objectives \\\\n upon the successful com pletion of this chapter , students will be able to : \\\\n ÷ d efi ne the ter ms 7 c ivic s ‘ , 7 e th ics ‘ a nd 7 mor ali ty ‘ \\\\n ÷ differentiate morality from ethics \\\\n ÷ explain sources of civic and ethical education \\\\n ÷ describe the goals of civic and ethical educ ation . \\\\n 1 . 2 . defines civics , ethics and morality \\\\n 1 . 2 . 1 . \\\\n definition \\\\n of \\\\n civic \\\\n education \\\\n ? \\\\n what does civic educ ation mean ? \\\\n unders tandi ng the idea of ci vic educ ation must begin with ex plain in g the origin and meani ng of \\\\n civics . ac cor dingl y , the \\\\n word \\\\n civics is \\\\n derived \\\\n from \\\\n t he \\\\n latin \\\\n wor d 7 civis ‘ \\\\n whic h means \\\\n a \\\\n citizen . \\\\n an other \\\\n latin \\\\n wor d \\\\n 7 civitas ‘ \\\\n means \\\\n ci ty -

state . both these two latin words have give birth to the social science known as civics . civics as an education for the first time delivered in ancient greek - city - state is called athens . during that previous time its main concern was teaching athenians about the 5 good life á . thus , civic education is , in short , an education for citizenship in which people get access to different kinds of knowledge . \\\\n different writers and organizations define civic education in different ways . the most cited definitions of civic education are the following listed below . these are : \\\\n civic education deals with the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a state . it is the study the purpose of government , the nature of the law , and the way private behavior affects the public order and political system . it also studies about the theory and practice of free and open democratic society . furthermore , it deals with international relationships of socio - economic and political conditions . from these mentioned above definitions we understood that civic education is a part of social science that studies everything about socio - economic and political arenas in a society at international , regional and national levels . \\\\n 1 . 2 . ethics and morality \\\\n ? \\\\n what is ethics ? \\\\n ethics is a branch of philosophy which deals with human actions from the moral point of view as right or wrong , good or bad , justice or injustice , morality or immorality . it is an attempt to understand and critically evaluate our moral values and principles and to see how these relate to our conduct , actions , and social arrangements . \\\\n ethics is a normative inquiry but not a descriptive one . it seeks to establish and prescribe norms , standards , or principles for evaluating our actual practices . it is used to designate the philosophical task of discerning which moral principles are rationally defensible and which actions are genuinely good or bad . in ethics , we are concerned with what we ought to do , what consequences ought to be achieved , and what sort of persons we ought to become . ethics may share common ground with the law , religious belief , popular opinion , professional codes and the dictates of authority figures , but it is also broader than all of these and offers a set of tools and values against which their appropriateness can be evaluated . \\\\n while morality can be viewed from different perspectives and let us start with the simple definition of the word itself . the term 5moralityá comes from the latin word 5 moralitas ” which \\\\n the following points are given below about the diff erence between ethics and morality . ethics morality is philosophical study of the code , standards refers value judgments , beliefs , principles , or norm of human conduct and rules for ordinary life . establishes the standards , norms , or codes to is the conformity of human behavior to the be followed by human beings are the study of established code of conduct . if an action morality , moral principles , and moral decision conform to the established code , it is called making . moral , if not immoral is the development of reasonable standards refers to the effort to guide one ‘ s conduct by and procedures for ethical decision - making . reason while giving equal weight to the interests of each individual who will be affected by one ‘ s conduct . is a set of normative rules of conduct , a code , has to do with what one should do , all things a standards that govern what one ought to do considered , not what , in fact , any of us will so when the well - being , or duties to oneself , in a particular instance . others or institutions is at stake . \\\\n 1. the difference between laws and ethics unlike ethics , laws are rules that govern certain human activities which are prescribed by a constitution , courts and the court system . in other words , laws are norms which are formally approved by state ‘ s government or international government bodies . they are binding on everyone and are enforced by penalties , such as fines or imprisonment . \\\\n many laws are instituted in order to promote well - being , resolve conflicts of interest , and promote social harmony . however , there are several reasons why ethics is not a law . first , some actions that are illegal may not be unethical . speeding is illegal , but one might have an ethical obligation to break the speed limit in order to transport someone to a hospital in an emergency . second , laws can be unethical or immoral . the united states had laws permitting slavery in the 1800 s , but most people today would say that those laws were unethical or immoral . although we have moral and ethical obligations to obey the law , civil disobedience can be justified when immoral or unethical laws exist . \\\\n third , we use different kinds of mechanisms to express , teach , inculcate , and enforce laws and ethics . laws are expressed publicly in statutes , penal codes , court rulings , government regulations , and so forth . although ethics and morals are sometimes made explicit in religious texts , professional codes of conduct , or philosophical writings , many ethical and moral standards are implicit . finally , we use the coercive power of government to enforce laws . people who break certain laws can be fined , imprisoned , or executed . however , people who violate ethical or moral standards do not face these kinds of punishments unless their actions also violate laws . \\\\n 1. sources of civic and ethical education civic and ethical education is a subject which is interdisciplinary . what makes a subject interdisciplinary ? a subject becomes interdisciplinary when it borrows shares or makes knowledge , theories , principles and explanations from different disciplines . civic and ethical education has several sources and takes knowledge from different disciplines or subjects . the sources of civic and ethical education can be generally classified in to two . a. theoretical sources are the various subjects which civic and ethical education borrows theories , principles and explanations . these include philosophy , political science , law , economics geography , history , sociology , psychology , and so on . for example , when you learn about morality or ethics , the source is philosophy . when you deal about democracy , state , government , citizenship , and etc , the source is political science . issues about human rights and constitution are originally taken from law . in the same manner , civic and ethical education as a field of study collects knowledge from the rest of the theoretical sources . b. documentary sources are the various materials which serve a source of the field of civic and ethical education . documentary sources include international instruments such as universal declaration of human rights , which is very important source on the right issue of human rights , and various kinds of covenants and conventions including covenant on economic , social and cultural rights as well as conventions such as convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women , convention on the rights of child , and etc. in addition , constitutions both federal and regional as well as legal enactments and decisions made by legal bodies , such as parliaments , state councils and various federal ministries are also sources of civic and ethical education . furthermore , \\\\n 7 \\\\n languages , culture and etc of others as well as to listen to the view points of others . therefore , civic and ethical education enables students to develop certain positive and relevant attitudes towards important values and virtues like tolerance . it also enables citizens to appreciate the values of dialogue , negotiation , tolerance , compromise diversity and so on . for example , a student who will learn about the multi - ethnic nature and various religious in ethiopia will develop a feeling of tolerance . that is , she or he starts respecting the culture , tradition , language and identity of the peoples of ethiopia than his / her own . \\\\n iii . national character and patriotism \\\\n patriotism refers to one ‘ s love , affection and devotion towards his / her country . citizens should always willing and ready to sacrifice everything for their motherland . they should be proud of their country . they should also be proud of their identity , cultural heritage and uphold the values of the society . for example , a student who has learnt about the glory , fame , and deeds of his / her ancestors as well as the history of his / her country will develop the feeling of patriotism . thus , all these feelings of patriotism could be inculcated by teaching civic and ethical education . \\\\n iv . developing a democratic political culture and strengthening democracy \\\\n democratic outlooks should be indoctrinated into the mind of the young generation . this can be realized by teaching students democratic values , principles , and cultivate them in such way that they could be able to shoulder the responsibility of their country . according to almond and verba ( 1963 ) describes participant culture as the most compatible with democratic political structures because the qualities and attitudes of citizens determine the health and stability of a country ‘ s democracy . this implies that in participant cultures , members of society have high cognitive , affective , and evaluative orientation to the political system , the input objects , the policy outputs , and recognize the self as an active participant in the polity . \\\\n political tolerance is critical to build up democratic system in a certain country . in democracy , peoples are allowed to hold and express their own political view . as result of such freedom , different view are circulated and reflected in the society . that is the beauty of democracy . citizens will have options to choose in such political markets . in order to ensure the freedom of expression an assembly , the culture of tolerance is a pillar . so , tolerance could mean \\\\n accommodation of political differences . therefore , civic and ethical education teaches students about democracy and democratization process . \\\\n v. conflict resolution and peace building \\\\n civic and ethical education is aimed at creating good citizens . it helps student to develop skills such as information inquiry and accurate decision making , conflict resolution , expression of oneself logically and clearly , use of respectful language , scientific reasoning , and so on . moreover , it also widely teaches students about the importance of the right attitudes that needs to ensure harmony and peaceful co - existence among people . off course , it is reasonable to claim that skillful manpower is a pre - requisite for every nation that wishes to develop but a skillful manpower without positive attitudes to work is likely to result in counter production because vices like corruption , bribery , abuse of power , violence of fundamental rights , lateness to and work absenteeism among others will pop their ugly heads . \\\\n one is morally accountable or responsible , and the proper end of law . when ethicists use word like 5goodá or 5rightá to describe a person or action they generally means that the person or action conforms to some standard . a good person or action has certain desirable qualities . \\\\n ö ethics is \\\\n 1. the critical examination and evaluation of what is good , evil , right and wrong in human \\\\n conduct ( guy , 2001 ) . \\\\n 2. ethics is the study of goodness , right action and moral responsibility , it asks what choices \\\\n and ends we ought to pursue and what moral principles should govern our pursuits and choices ( madden , 2000 ) . \\\\n ethicists often disagree about the nature of those standards and desirable qualities and follow different paths in establishing standards and discovering which qualities are desirable . for purposes of understanding , though , we can view ethics as divided into two fields ; meta - ethics and normative ethics . \\\\n 2. normative ethics \\\\n normative ethics involves arriving at moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct . the normative nature of ethics or moral philosophy lies in its attempt to discern evaluative standards for human conduct . \\\\n the 5wisdomá sought by the ethical or moral philosophers is evaluative standards - an understanding of what determines when something is good or bad , or right or wrong . it seeks to impose itself on us by telling us what human conduct should or ought to be like , if it is to merit a positive evaluation . \\\\n in a sense , normative ethics is a search for an ideal litmus test of proper behavior . the golden rule is a classic example of a normative principle : we should do to others what we would want others to do to us . since i do not want my neighbor to steal my car , then it is wrong for me to steal her car . since i would want people to feed me if i was starving , then i should help feed starving people . using this same reasoning , \\\\n i can theoretically determine whether any possible action is right or wrong . so , based on the golden rule , it would also be wrong for me to lie , harass , victimize , assault , or kill others . the golden rule is an example of a normative theory that establishes a single principle against which we judge all actions . other normative theories focus on a set of foundational principles , or a set of good character traits . \\\\n the key assumption in normative ethics is that there is only one ultimate criterion of moral conduct , whether it is a single rule or a set of principles . there are four strategies or approaches to normative ethics . these are : teleological ethics , duty ethics , virtue ethics and applied ethics . \\\\n 2 . 3 . teleological ethics \\\\n ÷ what is teleological ethics ? the term teleological derived from greek word 7 teo los ‘ means 7 end ‘ or 7 purpose ‘ / ‘ goal ‘ . thus , teleological ethics referred as 5the end justifies the mean sá . another name of teleological ethics is known as consequentialist ethics . consequentialist normative principles require that we first tally both the good and bad consequences of an action . second , we then determine whether the total good consequences outweigh the total bad consequences . if the good consequences are greater , then the action is morally proper . if the bad consequences are greater , then the action is morally improper . therefore , any theory that looks solely to consequences of actions is known as a consequentialist or teleological theory . \\\\n one of the most famous normative egoists was adam smith , one of the pioneers of neo - classical economic theory . he argued that self - interested behavior is right if it leads to morally acceptable ends . smith argued that if everyone followed their self - interest , then society as a whole would be improved . ( importantly , he also argued that if egoism led in fact to the worsening of society , then it should be abandoned . ) the theory of egoism is at the heart of capitalist arguments that a corporation ‘ s sole responsibility is to its shareholders . however , some form of social and environmental responsibility can be consistent with egoism because egoist decisions may address immediate moral demands by aiming to satisfy long - term self - maximizing objectives of the firm ( e . profitability ) or the individual ( e . philanthropy ) . while it is an important theory for understanding economic rationality , we do not consider egoism in great depth here . of more interest is another consequentialist theory that of utilitarianism . in contradiction to this , it is not agree with the italian states man , niccolo machiavelli ( 1469 - 1527 ) that if the end is to maintain political power for one self , ones king or ones political party , then this will justify any means that one might use for that propose , such as force , surveillance , or even deceit . although this famous theory is indeed consequentialist , it does not qualify as utilitarian , because it doesn ‘ t have the common good as its ultimate end . we may focus on the consequences of our actions because we believe that those consequences justify our actions ( i . , the end justify the means ) , but this does not necessarily imply that the consequences we hope for are good in the egoist sense that may maximize happiness for one self . \\\\n therefore , ethical egoist insisted that if you don ‘ t take advantage of a situation , you are foolish . the claim that it makes good sense to look after yourself , and morality is a result of that self interest . if i mistreat others , they mistreat me , so i resolve to behave myself . this is a rather twisted version of the golden rule ( do to others as you would have them do to you ) . it is twisted because it is peculiarly slanted toward our own self interests . the reason we should treat others the way we would like to be treated is that it gives us a good chance of receiving just such treatment ; we do it for ourselves , not for others . so , do unto others so that you will be done unto \\\\n in a similar way . accordingly , ethical egoism tells you that it is perfectly all right to treat others in a way that is to your advantage and not to theirs as long as you can be certain that you will get away with it . in addition , we usually assume that moral behavior , or being ethical , has to do with not being overly concerned with oneself . in other words , selfishness is assumed to be unacceptable attitude . \\\\n b ) utilitarianism \\\\n the modern form of the consequentialist theory of utilitarianism derives from british philosophers such as jeremy bentham ( 1748 - 1832 ) and john stuart mill ( 1806 - 1873 ) in the 19th century . it has been particularly influential in areas of the world influenced by british culture . utilitarianism is a universal teleological system . it focuses on collective welfare and identifies goodness with the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people and not merely the good of the agent . \\\\n utilitarianism is an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone . \\\\n jeremy bentham presented one of the earliest fully developed systems of utilitarianism . there is something appealing about bentham ‘ s utilitarianism . it is simple in that there is only one principle to apply : maximize pleasure and minimize suffering . it is also commonsensical in that we think that morality really is about reducing suffering and promoting benevolence . further , it is scientific one and simply makes quantitative measurements but not quality ; and apply the principle impartially , giving no special treatment to ourselves or to anyone else . bentham always argued that 5 we human beings are like other animals and hence ; whatever action we do , we are right as long as our action can bring greater pleasure than pain . á therefore , bentham ‘ s slogan : the right act or policy is the one that causes 7 the greatest happiness of the greatest number ‘ , that is , maximize the total utility or welfare of the majority of all the affected parties . \\\\n there are two main features of utilitarianism , both of which bentham articulated : first , bentham proposed that we tally the consequences of each action we perform and thereby determine on a case by case basis whether an action is morally right or wrong . this aspect of bentham 's theory is known as act - utilitarianism . act utilitarianism implies that one should assess whether an act is \\\\n include high culture , scientific knowledge , intellectuality , and creativity . although the lower pleasures are more intensely gratifying , they also lead to pain when overindulged in . the higher pleasures tend to be more long term , continuous , and gradual . mill argued that 5 it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied ; better to be socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied . á humans are the kind of creatures who require more to be truly happy . they want the lower pleasures , but they also want deep friendship , intellectual ability , culture , the ability to create and appreciate art , knowledge , and wisdom . the point is not merely that humans wouldn ‘ t be satisfied with what satisfies a pig but that somehow the quality of the higher pleasures is better . but what does it mean to speak of better pleasure ? the formula he comes up with is this : happiness ... [ is ] not a life of rapture ; but moments of such , in an existence made up of few and transitory pains , many and various pleasures , with a decided predominance of the active over the passive , and having as the foundation of the whole , not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing . mill is clearly pushing the boundaries of the concept of 5pleasureá by emphasizing higher qualities such as knowledge , intelligence , freedom , friendship , love , and health . in fact , one might even say that his litmus test for happiness really has little to do with actual pleasure and more to do with a non - hedonic cultivated state of mind . \\\\n john stuart mill 's version of utilitarianism is rule - oriented because the alternative to act - utilitarianism is a view called rule - utilitarianism - elements of which we find in mill ‘ s theory . according to rule - utilitarianism , a behavioral code or rule is morally right if the consequences of adopting that rule are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone . in other words , rule utilitarianism is an act is right if and only if it is required by a rule that is itself a member of a set of rules whose acceptance would lead to greater utility for society than any available alternative . human beings are rule - following creatures . we learn by adhering to the rules of a given subject , whether it is speaking a language , driving a car , dancing , writing an essay , rock climbing , or cooking . we want to have a set of action guiding rules by which to live . the act - utilitarian rule , to do the act that maximizes utility , is too general for most purposes . often , we don ‘ t have time to decide whether lying will produce more utility than truth telling , so we need a more specific rule prescribing truthfulness that passes the test of rational scrutiny . \\\\n unlike act utilitarianism , which weighs the consequences of each particular action , rule - utilitarianism offers a litmus test only for the morality of moral rules , such as \\\\\\\" stealing is wrong . \\\\\\\" \\\\n adopting a rule against theft clearly has more favorable consequences than unfavorable consequences for everyone . the same is true for moral rules against lying or murdering . rule - utilitarianism , then , offers a three - tiered method for judging conduct . a particular action , such as stealing my neighbor 's car , is judged wrong since it violates a moral rule against theft . in turn , the rule against theft is morally binding because adopting this rule produces favorable consequences for everyone . \\\\n c ) altruism it is a principle that proposes we ought as much as possible to seek the good of others . altruists are people who act so as to increase other people ‘ s pleasure . they will act for the sake of someone else even if it decreases their own pleasure and causes themselves pain . we can differentiate egoistic and altruistic desires in the following way : one ‘ s desire is egoistic if ( and only if ) it concerns ( what one perceives to be ) the benefit of oneself and not anyone else . in the contrary , one ‘ s desire is altruistic if ( and only if ) it concerns ( what one perceives to be ) the benefit of at least someone other than oneself . altruists reject the theory of psychological egoism and argue instead that humans are instinctively benevolent . and instinctive benevolence , they argue , is the feature of our human nature which is the basis of our altruistic moral obligations . \\\\n altruism is an action is right if the consequences of that action are favorable to all except the actor or agent . \\\\n 2 . 3 . deontological ( non - consequentialist ) ethics \\\\n what is duty ethics ? what duty ethics ask for us ? \\\\n in many respects , deontological moral theory is diametrically the opposite of utilitarianism . it is referred as 5the means justifies the end á . it is coined as 5 deontics á . this is a theory that the rightness or wrongness of moral action is determined , at least partly with reference to formal rules of conduct rather than consequences or result of an action . this implies that this ethics emphasis on the intentions , motives , moral principles or performance of duty rather than results , as the sign of right action / morality and immorality . \\\\n commanded neither a nor not - a for s. bringing out the implications of this , we may list four propositions : \\\\n a ) . act a is wrong if and only if it is contrary to the command of god . b ) . act a is right ( required ) if and only if it is commanded by god . c ) . act a is morally permissible if and only if it is permitted by the command of god . d ) . if there is no god , then nothing is ethically wrong , required , or permitted . we can summarize the divine commend theory this way : morality not only originates with god , but moral rightness simply means 5 willed by godá and moral wrongness means 5 being against the will of god á . that is , an act is right in virtue of being permitted by the will of god , and an act is wrong in virtue of being against the will of god . because morality essentially is based on divine will , not on independently existing reasons for action , no further reasons for action are necessary . so we may ask , 5 if god doesn ‘ t exist , everything is permissible ? á if so , nothing is forbidden or required . without god , we have moral nihilism . if there is no god , then nothing is ethically wrong , required , or permitted . \\\\n b. rights theory this theory is a second duty - based approach of ethics . a right is a justified claim against another person ‘ s behavior . so , rights and duties are related in that the rights of one person imply the duty of someone else to uphold that right . for instance , if i have a right to payment of 5000 eth by kassahun , then kassahun has a duty to pay me 5000 eth . this is called the correlativity of rights and duties . \\\\n the concept of individual human rights is fundamental to western legal systems , and has developed both from the argument that all humans have certain natural rights and from religious notions that rights come from god . the most influential early account of rights theory is that of 17 th century british philosopher john locke , who argued that the laws of nature mandate that we should not harm anyone 's life , health , liberty or possessions * * . * * for locke , these are our natural rights , given to us by god . following locke , the united states declaration of independence authored by thomas jefferson recognizes three foundational rights : life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . jefferson and others rights theorists maintained that we deduce other more specific rights from these , including the rights of property , movement , speech , and religious expression . \\\\n there are four features traditionally associated with moral rights . these are : \\\\n ÷ first , rights are natural insofar as they are not invented or created by governments . ÷ second , they are universal insofar as they do not change from country to country . ÷ third , they are equal in the sense that rights are the same for all people , irrespective of gender , race , or handicap . ü fourth , they are inalienable which means that i cannot hand over my rights to another person , such as by selling myself into slavery . \\\\n throughout the 19th century , the justification for rights became more secular , but rights were usually confined to the nation . however , the idea that rights were liberties guaranteed to citizens of a nation was challenged in the 20th century by the realisation that nazi germany acted legally under german law when it committed what were later classified as crimes against humanity . after second world war , the united nations ‘ universal declaration of human rights of 1948 is based on the reasoning that justice and equal treatment of humans ought to be applied universally . \\\\n c. kant ’s categorical imperative the german philosopher , immanuel kant ( 1724 - 1804 ) is identified with the moral theory known as deontology . kant was adamantly opposed to the idea that the outcome of an action could determine its moral worth . for deontologists , it is not consequences which determine the rightness or wrongness of an act , but , rather the intention of the person who carries out the act . the emphasis is on the correctness of the action , regardless of the possible benefits or harm it might produce . deontologists maintain that there are some moral obligations which are absolutely binding , no matter what consequences are produced . \\\\n a kant ‘ s duty - based theory is emphasizes a single principle of duty . kant agreed that we have moral duties to oneself and others , such as developing one ‘ s talents , and keeping our promises to others . however , kant argued that there is a more foundational principle of duty that encompasses our particular duties . it is a single , self - evident principle of reason that he calls the 5 categorical imperative . á\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"4 6037396594108665912 - Chapter One 1.

h _ makes us realise how far man » a free being , \\\\n how far the external influences limit the lpotcntialities of hia \\\\n career | or the his personality and how far \\\\n he influences the environment civics also deals with other \\\\n problems , such as men 's duties in a particular environment and \\\\n li intro dug tjon \\\\n • » ■ \\\\n the methods of their performnneer the ‘ forms nnd institutions \\\\n which will lead him into a harmonious relation with his re - \\\\n created or perfected surroundings . \\\\n a preparatory knowledge about one ’s duty as a citizen \\\\n or a patriot or a cosmopolite requires a thorough knowledge \\\\n of the past history , of the present institutions and beliefs , and \\\\n a survey of geographical features and influences whether un - \\\\n touched by the hand of man or recreated by him . \\\\n if the idea of civics as it is conceived to - day is to restrict \\\\n its scope to nations , then it becomes an intensive study of a \\\\n particular culture , its present condition and its future work , \\\\n nnd consequently racial forms nnd thoughts , grooves and \\\\n tendencies , receive more attention than larger human values \\\\n or virtues . the science of civics is to - day conceived and \\\\n dealt with in the spirit of national and not in the spirit of \\\\n cosmopolitan values . , . \\\\n we have just commenced its study in india from the indian \\\\n point of view . my desire is to perform this task in the follow - \\\\n ing pages in an elementary way . \\\\n european writers approach the study of civics with ideas \\\\n borrowed from their own history or society and from the \\\\n classical history and literature of greece nnd rome . these \\\\n two have played a very large part in moulding the thoughts \\\\n nnd beliefs , the customs nnd conventions of europeans . in \\\\n india we are the inheritors of a vedic civilisation which \\\\n moulded our life differently from that of the europeans . \\\\n therefore in our study of civics and politics it is essential to \\\\n note first the general features of our social and political th bught \\\\n in order to be able to appreciate fully the various social and \\\\n political factors which are influencing our life to - day . \\\\n in a study of this kind we find hardly any books which \\\\n try to point out the individual mentality and social theories \\\\n which an , indian student brings to bear on the problems of \\\\n civics and politics . his mental outlook and civic endeavours \\\\n are moulded largely by his social and religious traditions which \\\\n are based on his social theories nnd religious convictions when \\\\n introduction \\\\n ke comes m contact v ytb * ^ ew ideas which lead him lo new \\\\n values of life and conceptions of the future \\\\n therefore it has become very necessary to state the general \\\\n social theory of the hindus in the very beginning of this book \\\\n in order to help the student in valuing the old and the new \\\\n conceptions of civic and political life \\\\n there is another aspect from which this treatment of the \\\\n hindu social theory is also important to day every belief , \\\\n every institution and every science are examined m the light \\\\n of the idea of progress this idea was absent in the early \\\\n speculations of the east as well as the west the rta - idea \\\\n of cosmic order , the yuga idea of successive det * noration and \\\\n cycles of the hindus , the idea of degeneration and decay or \\\\n periods of cycles of the creeks and romans the idea of \\\\n predestination and providential design of the mediaeval thinkers \\\\n had moulded the outlook and confined the efforts of the peoples \\\\n m pre modern history even their theories of freedom , in - \\\\n dividual and social , worked under these limitations of individual \\\\n and worldly conceptions hindus and moslems have not as \\\\n yet given up this outlook on the course of human life hence \\\\n it has become necessary to examine the various factors and \\\\n beliefs of the traditional outlook and to state the strength they \\\\n bring to beat on the problems of their civil life in all its phases \\\\n and aspects ^ \\\\n thus such a preliminary statement of the hindu social \\\\n theory will serve two purposes firstly it will give a correct \\\\n idea of the traditional mentality and theory of the hindus \\\\n about social and civic life and ideals \\\\u003c . secondly it will serve \\\\n as a study m contrast of the two different outlooks which must \\\\n coalesce in their conflict or merge one into the other in order \\\\n to make a happy and harmonious life in the future possible \\\\n an introduction \\\\n to \\\\n civics and politics \\\\n chapter i \\\\n hindu social theory \\\\n the aim of the hindus has been to produce the best man \\\\n morally and spiritually by a life of conscious , social and in divi -

\\\\n ed against the encroachments of higher \\\\n units but were duly subordinated to the greater social interests \\\\n of the higher groups . there was more of devolution and less of \\\\n interference from the above . only in cases of conflicts or \\\\n joint interests of similar units the higher groups were expected \\\\n to interfere or to bring about co - operation and co - ordination . \\\\n the lowest unit was kul n , and then higher in order were \\\\n 5 reni , j fili . pugn , gann , gram n . purn , jan npn dn and rn . strn . \\\\n the king was the final adjudicator of disputes and conflicting \\\\n interests . he was not the supreme law - giver , nor the ir respon - \\\\n sible lender , nor the fountain of justice , nor the one primary \\\\n landowner . he was the national representative , and the \\\\n guardian of the pence . he was bound by oath to dhn rmn \\\\n and to people to govern well . but in this function also he \\\\n was to observe the laws of the society and to cnr rj ' out the \\\\n interpretations or applications of these laws with the help of the \\\\n guardians of society or the council of the learned or the wise . \\\\n he himself was bound by the laws . he had duties to observe \\\\n and virtues to develop . thus ultimately the hindu concep - \\\\n tion led to a system of laws or constitution , called dhn rmn , \\\\n nt the top . in it the king and the various groups had their \\\\n functions laid down , their jurisdictions stated and their in -
