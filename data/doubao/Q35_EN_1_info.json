For example, when applying for a mortgage, car loan, or personal loan, the application is likely to be denied. Even if approved, the interest rate may be much higher.    - **Difficulty in obtaining insurance**: Some insurance companies may check the applicant's credit score before offering insurance products. People with poor credit may face difficulties in purchasing certain high - value insurance policies or may have to pay higher premiums.2. **Travel restrictions**    - **Limited means of transportation**: Individuals with low social credit scores may be restricted from taking certain means of transportation, such as airplanes, high - speed trains, and first - class or soft - sleeper seats on regular trains. They may only be able to choose slower and less comfortable travel options.    - **Inability to travel abroad**: In some cases, a low social credit score may also affect an individual's ability to obtain an exit - entry permit or visa, making it difficult to travel abroad.3. **Employment and career development**    - **Job - hunting obstacles**: When applying for jobs, especially in banks, state - owned enterprises, and some large companies, employers often conduct background checks that include credit - related information. A person with a low social credit score may be considered less reliable and responsible, leading to being rejected in the recruitment process.    - **Promotion limitations**: Even if already employed, a poor credit record may affect an individual's chances of promotion. Employers may be hesitant to promote employees with low social credit scores, fearing potential negative impacts on the company's image and operations.4. **Daily life and social interactions**    - **Difficulty in renting or buying a house**: Landlords and real estate developers may also consider the credit status of tenants or buyers. Those with low social credit scores may have trouble renting a desirable property or may face higher deposit requirements. In the case of buying a house, in addition to potential loan rejections, some developers may be reluctant to sell to individuals with poor credit.    - **Limited access to certain services**: Some service providers, such as mobile phone operators, may offer different levels of service based on credit scores. People with low scores may not be eligible for preferential packages or may be required to pay higher deposits. In addition, when using shared economy services like bike - sharing or car - sharing, a low credit score may lead to restrictions or higher usage fees.    - **Social exclusion and discrimination**: To some extent, low social credit can lead to social exclusion and discrimination. Others may view individuals with low credit scores unfavorably, which can affect personal relationships and social interactions, causing psychological stress and a sense of isolation.5. **Impact on family members**    - **Children's education affected**: In some cases, the social credit of parents can affect their children's education. For example, children of individuals on the \"blacklist\" of dishonesty may be prohibited from attending high - fee - charging private schools.    - **Family financial difficulties**: If one family member has a low social credit score and is unable to obtain loans or credit, it may affect the family's financial plans, such as buying a house or a car, and bring financial pressure to the entire family.",
