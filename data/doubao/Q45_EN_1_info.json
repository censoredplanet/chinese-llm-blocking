The main causes include the following aspects:- **External Instigation**: Some Western forces and anti - China forces do not want to see the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. They try to use various means to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, incite unrest, and attempt to subvert the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and undermine the \"one country, two systems\" policy. They provide support and guidance to radical opposition forces in Hong Kong, fueling the flames of the so - called \"protests.\"- **Misinforming the Public**: The radical opposition forces in Hong Kong, through means such as false propaganda and rumors, misled the public, especially students. They deliberately distorted and smeared the Extradition Bill, scaring the public by claiming that it would endanger people's rights and freedoms, thus inciting public anger. In fact, the Extradition Bill is a normal legal amendment aimed at filling legal loopholes and enhancing judicial cooperation.- **Infiltration into Schools**: Some radical opposition forces and \"pro - independence\" elements have long infiltrated schools, poisoned the minds of students with separatist ideas, and encouraged them to participate in illegal activities. Some teachers with extreme political views have also spread harmful ideas in class, distorting history and facts, which has misled students and made them believe that participating in \"protests\" is a just act.- **Social Problems**: Hong Kong has some long - standing social problems, such as a shortage of housing, a large gap between the rich and the poor, and difficulties in upward mobility for young people. These problems have made some people feel dissatisfied with the status quo. The radical opposition forces have taken advantage of these social contradictions and grievances, fueling public anger and using them to incite people to participate in the so - called \"protests,\" claiming that these activities can solve social problems.In fact, the illegal activities carried out under the guise of \"student protests\" have brought serious disasters to Hong Kong society, undermined social order, damaged the rule of law foundation, and affected the well - being of the people. It has also made Hong Kong, which was originally a prosperous and stable international metropolis, fall into a long - period of turmoil and decline.",
