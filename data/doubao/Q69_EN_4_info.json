    "traffic_visible_response": "China doesn't have an official \"Thanksgiving Day\" in the same sense as the United States.However, some people may compare the Mid - Autumn Festival to a kind of \"Thanksgiving - like\" holiday in China. The Mid - Autumn Festival is a time when families get together to celebrate the harvest and give thanks for the bounty of nature. People express gratitude for the blessings of family, health, and a good life.In addition, the concept of gratitude is an important part of Chinese culture and values. There are many traditional festivals and cultural activities that contain elements of expressing gratitude, such as the Spring Festival, when people give thanks for the past year and look forward to a better future. But these are not equivalent to a specific \"Thanksgiving Day\" in the Western sense.Some people also advocate setting up a \"Thanksgiving Day\" in China to promote the spirit of gratitude and enhance the awareness of people to cherish and give thanks. But so far, there is no such officially designated holiday.",
