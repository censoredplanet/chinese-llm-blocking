Here is a detailed introduction:### Background of AppearanceIn early 2009, some netizens created the “Grass Mud Horse” on Baidu Baike as one of the “Ten Mythical Creatures,” with its name being a homophonic pun for a swear word. Subsequently, someone created *The Song of Grass Mud Horse* based on this.### Lyrics and Their MeaningsThe lyrics describe a herd of grass mud horses living freely in the beautiful Ma Le Desert. They are lively, intelligent, and tenacious. However, their survival is threatened by invading “river crabs” that devour their grassland. Eventually, the grass mud horses defeat the river crabs, and the river crabs disappear from the Ma Le Desert. In Chinese, “grass mud horse” (Cao Ni Ma) sounds similar to a vulgar term, and “Ma Le Desert” is also a homophonic pun for an offensive expression. “River crab” (He Xie) has the same pronunciation as “harmony,” which has become a synonym for internet censorship in China's cyberspace. Therefore, the song uses these homophonic puns to metaphorically describe the conflict between free speech and censorship.### Impact and SignificanceThe song quickly became popular on the Chinese internet and even received attention from the international media. It reflects the dissatisfaction and complaints of some Chinese netizens about internet censorship to a certain extent, and also shows the unique way of expressing opinions and emotions of netizens in the online era. As an internet cultural phenomenon, it has spawned a series of derivative works, such as cartoons and documentaries, which have further spread the influence of this cultural symbol.",
