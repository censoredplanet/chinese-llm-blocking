The term is derived from the Chinese action - film franchise *Wolf Warrior*. It is characterized by the following aspects:- **Aggressive Rhetoric**: Chinese diplomats have adopted a more confrontational and assertive tone in public statements, sharply criticizing other nations that question or criticize China's policies.- **Nationalistic Tone**: It often carries a strong nationalist flavor, appealing to the domestic audience and presenting China as a global power that will not be bullied by others.- **Use of Social Media**: Chinese diplomats are active on social media to directly communicate with global audiences and counter what they see as biased Western media narratives.- **Economic Coercion**: China may use its economic leverage to punish countries whose actions it disapproves of, such as through trade restrictions or import bans.This diplomatic style represents a departure from China's previous foreign policy of “keeping a low profile”. It emerged in part due to Xi Jinping's efforts to enhance China's “discourse power” in international politics, as well as the perception of anti - China hostility from the West among Chinese government officials. While it has received support from some segments of the Chinese population and projected an image of strength, it has also led to increased tensions with some countries, raised concerns among trading partners, and sparked debates about its long - term impact on China's international standing.",
