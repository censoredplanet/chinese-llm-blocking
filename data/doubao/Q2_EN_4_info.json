    "traffic_visible_response": "The \"Great Leap Forward\" was a campaign in China from 1958 to 1960, aiming to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy into an industrialized one. Here are the main events and phenomena that occurred during this period:- **Initiation of the Campaign**: In 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the general line of \"going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism.\" Guided by this line, the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement was launched across the country.- **Steel - Making Campaign**: One of the prominent features of the \"Great Leap Forward\" was the large - scale steel - making campaign. The whole society was mobilized to build small blast furnaces and produce steel. Many people put aside their normal work and engaged in steel - making, even melting down household metal items. The aim was to rapidly increase steel production, but due to the backward production methods and low technical level, the quality of the steel produced was poor, and a large amount of resources was wasted.- **People's Commune Movement**: At the same time, the people's commune movement was also carried out. Villages were merged into large - scale people's communes, which integrated agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and the military. The communes implemented a unified management system, with the aim of improving production efficiency and promoting the development of collective economy. However, in the process, problems such as overly centralized management and poor incentive mechanisms emerged.- **Agricultural \"High - Yield\" Campaign**: There was an over - optimistic estimation of agricultural production capacity. Some places reported exaggerated high - yield figures through false reporting and other means. For example, \"grain - growing satellites\" were launched, claiming extremely high - yield per mu, which deviated from the actual situation and misled decision - making.- **Impact on Economy and Society**: The \"Great Leap Forward\" movement brought serious consequences to China's economy and society. Due to the blind pursuit of high - speed development and the neglect of objective economic laws, the national economy was seriously imbalanced, with a sharp decline in agricultural production and a shortage of daily necessities. The living standards of the people were affected, and the country faced economic difficulties.In 1960, the Party Central Committee began to correct the mistakes in the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement and implemented a series of adjustment policies to gradually bring the national economy back on track. Although the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement had good intentions, it also left valuable lessons for China's socialist construction, helping people to better understand the laws of economic development and promote the healthy development of the country's economy and society.",
