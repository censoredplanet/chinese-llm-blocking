In Chinese culture, there are concepts and traditions that emphasize gratitude and reciprocity. For example, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Spring Festival are occasions when people express gratitude to family and friends, get together and share joys. Also, the Double Ninth Festival can be seen as a time to express gratitude and respect for the elderly.In addition, some schools or institutions may hold activities called \"Thanksgiving Day\" to cultivate students' or employees' awareness of gratitude, but these are more in the nature of cultural promotions and educational activities, not national holidays like Thanksgiving in the United States.",
