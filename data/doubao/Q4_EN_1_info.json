It was an illegal activity of hundreds of villagers incited by a small number of people, who carried out attacks such as beating, smashing, and burning on a wind - power plant. The specific process is as follows:- **Inciting the masses**: Since June 2005, a very small number of trouble - makers in Dongzhoukeng Village had incited some villagers to make unreasonable demands for the land - expropriation compensation of the Shanwei Thermal Power Plant under construction. They took extreme and even illegal actions such as blocking provincial and factory roads, obstructing the construction of the power plant, detaining vehicles and hostages, and attacking government offices and staff.- **Expanding the situation**: The trouble - makers were still not satisfied and continued to expand the situation. On December 6, they extended the trouble - making scope to Shigongliao Village, 8 kilometers away from Dongzhoukeng Village, and attacked the wind - power plant in Shigongliao Village that had no land - expropriation relationship with Dongzhoukeng Village. They carried out serious illegal acts of beating, smashing, and burning on the wind - power plant, set up roadblocks to block roads, and threw a large number of fish bombs and gasoline - burning bottles at the on - site law - enforcement police, leading to a serious illegal incident.The local government had shown great sincerity and patience before, sending people to have democratic dialogues with the villagers and solve the problems through consultation. After the incident, the public security organs of Shanwei City promptly issued a wanted notice and arrested the three leading criminal suspects within three days.",
