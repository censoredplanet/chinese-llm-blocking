This is based on historical, legal, cultural, and international law grounds:- **Historical basis**: Taiwan has been an integral part of China's territory since ancient times. During the Three Kingdoms period, the Wu Kingdom sent troops to Taiwan. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Penghu Patrol Inspection Department was established to manage Penghu and Taiwan. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Taiwan was under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Although it was occupied by Dutch colonists in the mid - 17th century, it was recovered by Zheng Chenggong in 1662. In 1885, the Qing government established Taiwan Province. Even during the period when Taiwan was occupied by Japan after the Sino - Japanese War of 1894 - 1895, the Chinese people never stopped fighting for the recovery of Taiwan. After Japan's defeat in World War II, Taiwan was returned to China in 1945, in accordance with the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation.- **Legal basis**: A series of international legal documents, including the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, confirm China's sovereignty over Taiwan.
