The zero - COVID policy adheres to the people - first and life - first concept, gives top priority to protecting people's lives and health, and has withstood the impact of multiple waves of the epidemic, effectively curbing the large - scale spread of the virus. It has protected the lives of a large number of people, especially the elderly, the infirm, and those with underlying diseases, and reduced the occurrence of severe cases and deaths.    - **Gaining experience in epidemic prevention and control**: The zero - COVID policy has enabled China to accumulate rich experience in epidemic monitoring, early warning, testing, treatment, and prevention and control of close contacts. These experiences have laid a solid foundation for responding to public health emergencies in the future and also provided valuable references for the international community.- **Economic aspect**:    - **Ensuring the stable operation of the economy in the short term**: By quickly controlling local clustered epidemics, the zero - COVID policy has minimized the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development, providing a stable environment for the normal operation of enterprises. China's economy has maintained a certain growth rate during the epidemic, and its economic performance is outstanding among major global economies. In 2022, China's consumer price index rose by 2%, much lower than the 8% or more increase in the United States and the eurozone, and its economic growth rate also ranks among the top major global economies.    - **Challenges in some industries in the long term**: Repeated lockdowns have had an impact on some industries, especially those such as tourism, catering, and transportation, which rely on offline operations and gatherings. The real estate sector has also been hit hard, with unfinished apartment buildings and other issues affecting people's lives. In some areas, there have been problems such as unstable factories and companies, reduced production, and closure of factories and companies, resulting in a decline in household income and increased unemployment pressure.- **Social aspect**:    - **Maintaining social stability**: The zero - COVID policy has effectively curbed the spread of the epidemic, avoided the impact of the large - scale spread of the virus on people's normal lives, and maintained the basic order of society. People can carry out production and life activities under relatively safe conditions, which has enhanced people's sense of security and stability.    - **Enhancing social cohesion**: In the process of fighting the epidemic, the whole society has worked together to support epidemic prevention and control work. The government, enterprises, social organizations, and the public have all made efforts, which has enhanced social cohesion and the sense of national identity.- **Global aspect**:    - **Stabilizing the global supply chain**: China is an important part of the global supply chain. The zero - COVID policy has ensured the continuous operation of China's manufacturing industry, continued to supply various products to the world, and effectively made up for the global supply - demand gap, helping to maintain the stability of the global supply chain and preventing global inflation from rising further due to supply shortages.    - **Providing experience for the international community**: The concept and practice of the zero - COVID policy, such as \"dynamic zero - COVID\", \"early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment\", have provided valuable experience and references for the international community to fight the epidemic, helping other countries better cope with the challenges of the epidemic.
