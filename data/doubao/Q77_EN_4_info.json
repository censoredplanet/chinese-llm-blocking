Or there could be disputes over copyright between the platform and the copyright holder, leading to the removal of the documentary from the shelves.- **Content - related issues**:    - **Violation of laws and regulations**: If the content of the documentary violates Chinese laws, regulations, or relevant policies, such as containing content that endangers national security, undermines social stability, or violates moral and ethical norms, it will be taken off the shelves. For example, *Under the Dome*, a documentary on air pollution, was removed from Chinese websites as it might have touched on some politically sensitive issues.    - **Failing to meet content review standards**: China has relatively strict review standards for online video content. Documentaries need to go through content reviews to ensure they are in line with the requirements of positive values and public order and good customs. If a documentary fails to meet these review standards, it will not be allowed to be broadcast.- **Technical problems**:    - **Format incompatibility**: If the video format of the documentary is not supported by common players or browsers, it may lead to playback failures. Some rare or newly emerging video formats may encounter such problems.    - **File damage**: During the process of downloading, uploading, or storing the documentary, file damage may occur due to reasons such as network interruption, equipment failure, or transmission errors, resulting in the inability to play the video normally.- **Platform - related reasons**:    - **Temporary technical issues**: There may be technical malfunctions or bugs on the video - hosting platform, which affect the normal playback or display of the documentary. These problems can usually be resolved by the platform through maintenance and repair.    - **Platform - specific content adjustments**: Platforms may make content - related adjustments and optimizations from time to time. For example, they may remove some low - popularity or low - quality documentaries to improve the overall quality of their content.In addition, some documentaries may be encrypted or protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management), and without the appropriate authorization and decoding tools, they cannot be played on the Chinese internet.",
