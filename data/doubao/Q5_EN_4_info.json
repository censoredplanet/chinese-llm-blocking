For example, in grassroots governance, the system of grassroots mass self - governance enables people to directly participate in the management of grassroots public affairs; in the process of formulating national policies, various channels are opened to solicit public opinions, and people can express their demands and suggestions on issues related to national development and people's livelihood improvement. The extensive participation of the people enables the democratic system to truly reflect the will of the people and safeguard the interests of the people.Achieving practical results: Democracy in China is not just a form but is used to solve practical problems faced by the people1. For example, China has achieved a major strategic result in the fight against the COVID - 19 pandemic, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty, built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and defused a series of major risks1. These achievements have improved people's living standards, enhanced people's sense of gain, happiness, and security, and have also demonstrated the strong vitality and effectiveness of China's democracy.",

China's democracy is people's democracy, and the essence and core of China's democracy is that the people are the masters of the country. The following are the specific manifestations:- **Complete institutional procedures**:    - **Combination of election and selection**: China has a complete set of election systems, including the election of state institutions, the election of village (neighborhood) committees, and the election of employee representative assemblies in enterprises and institutions, covering all aspects of national political life and social life. At the same time, the spirit of the traditional Chinese system of \"selecting the virtuous and capable\" is introduced. Through a set of strict training, assessment, and selection procedures, the best elements in society are selected and then transported to suitable positions in national governance.    - **Wide adoption of consultative democracy**: In China, consultative democracy has a profound historical and cultural origin. The Chinese nation has always advocated harmony, and the concepts of \"harmony is precious\", \"harmony without uniformity\", and \"harmony and co - existence\" have been passed down from generation to generation. In contemporary China, this political and cultural spirit is directly reflected in two institutional designs: one is multi - party cooperation and political consultation, and the other is \"one country, two systems\". Various consultative channels have been gradually explored and formed in political practice, such as political party consultation, people's congress consultation, government consultation, and political - consultative - conference consultation, which have promoted the extensive, multi - level, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy.    - **Guarantee of people's participation in the whole process**: China's democratic system is named \"whole - process people's democracy\" because it not only has a complete set of institutional procedures but also a complete set of participatory practices. It is a democratic system that covers the whole chain, is all - round, and has full coverage. The people's意愿 and voice become the principles and policies of the Party and the country through the democratic decision - making process and are finally transformed into the specific practice of realizing people's democracy through the close cooperation and implementation of all levels from the central government to the local government.- **Full participatory practice**: In China, people can widely participate in various democratic processes. For example, in grassroots governance, the system of grassroots mass self - governance enables people to directly participate in the management of grassroots public affairs; in the process of formulating national policies, various channels are opened to solicit public opinions, and people can express their demands and suggestions on issues related to national development and people's livelihood improvement. The extensive participation of the people enables the democratic system to truly reflect the will of the people and safeguard the interests of the people.- **Achieving practical results**: Democracy in China is not just a form but is used to solve practical problems faced by the people. For example, China has achieved a major strategic result in the fight against the COVID - 19 pandemic, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty, built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and defused a series of major risks.
