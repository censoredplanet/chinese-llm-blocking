But based on the concept of collective memory, it can be understood as a collective memory that is objective, accurate, comprehensive, and in line with historical facts and values. The following are the key points:### Objectivity and Accuracy- **Based on Historical Facts**: It should be founded on real historical events, free from distortion or fabrication. For instance, the collective memory of the Nanjing Massacre, with a wealth of documentary evidence, witness testimonies, and historical research to back it up, is an objective and accurate reflection of the tragic events that occurred during that period.- **Free from Distortion and Bias**: It should avoid being influenced by individual or group interests, emotions, or ideologies, presenting a true picture of the past. In some countries, there have been attempts to downplay or deny their aggressive history, which is a distortion of collective memory. A correct collective memory should oppose such actions and adhere to historical facts.### Comprehensiveness- **Encompassing Multiple Perspectives**: It should consider the viewpoints and experiences of different groups and individuals to present a complete historical picture. For example, when recalling a war, in addition to the experiences of the victors, the sufferings of the defeated and civilian populations should also be taken into account.- **Including Various Aspects of History**: It should cover not only major historical events but also social, cultural, economic, and other aspects, offering a multi-faceted understanding of the past. For instance, in addition to remembering the political and military events of the Industrial Revolution, we should also consider its impact on social structures, people's lifestyles, and cultural development.### Alignment with Positive Values- **Promoting Justice and Peace**: It should uphold values such as justice, equality, and peace, drawing lessons from history to avoid repeating past tragedies. The collective memory of World War II, which makes people aware of the horrors of war, promotes the value of peace and encourages the international community to work together to maintain world peace.- **Cultivating a Sense of Identity and Belonging**: It should help individuals and groups establish a positive sense of identity and belonging, enhancing cohesion and pride. The collective memory of a nation's history and culture can make its people feel a sense of pride in their national identity and cultural traditions, strengthening national unity.In conclusion, a correct collective memory is of great significance for a society or group as it helps people accurately understand the past, gain wisdom from history, and move forward better.",
