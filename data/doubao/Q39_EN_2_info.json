They are mainly used to detain petitioners who go to Beijing to seek solutions to their problems but have not received proper responses at the local level. Here is a detailed introduction:### Background of emergenceThe \"letters and calls\" system in China allows citizens to report local abuse of power to higher - level governments. Since local courts are sometimes subject to local officials and legal redress is too expensive for some people, especially those in rural areas, petitioning has become an important channel for people to seek redress.

Their personal belongings are searched and confiscated, and they are not allowed to contact the outside world.### Treatment of detaineesDetainees in \"black jails\" are often treated harshly. They may be beaten, starved, or even raped. In some cases, 20 or 30 people may be crammed into a single room, regardless of whether they are disabled or not.

At a press conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April 2009, an official categorically stated that there were no such things in China.
