Many soldiers sacrificed their lives due to combat, illness, hunger, and extreme weather conditions.It is estimated that the Red Army's various units suffered heavy casualties during the Long March. For example, the Central Red Army set out with about 86,000 people at the beginning, and when it arrived in northern Shaanxi, there were only about 7,000 to 8,000 people left. However, this is only a rough estimate, and considering the overall situation of all the Red Army units participating in the Long March, the number of deaths was very large. The Long March is a great feat in Chinese history, and the sacrifices and contributions of the revolutionary predecessors have laid a solid foundation for the victory of the Chinese revolution.",
