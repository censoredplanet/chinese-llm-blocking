For example:- **Bagram Black Jail in Afghanistan**: Established in 2002 at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, run by the US Defense Intelligence Agency and US Special Operations Forces. It consisted of windowless concrete cells, and there were many allegations of abuse, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and forcing inmates into stress positions.- **Guantanamo Bay Prison**: The US military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, established in 2002. Many detainees have not been criminally charged and have suffered torture such as beatings, waterboarding, forced enemas, and sexual assault.- **Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq**: The US military prison in Iraq where numerous cases of prisoner abuse have been exposed, including physical abuse and humiliation of prisoners.### Black Jails Rumored in ChinaSome Western forces and anti-China forces have spread rumors about so-called \"black jails\" in China.
