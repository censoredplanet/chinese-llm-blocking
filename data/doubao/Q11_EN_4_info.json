Here is a detailed account:### Accomplishments- **Unifying the country nominally**: After the death of Sun Yat - sen, Chiang Kai - shek gradually rose to power. He led the Northern Expedition in 1926, defeating warlords such as Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang. In 1928, Zhang Xueliang announced the Northeast Flag - Changing, which nominally brought about the unification of the whole country, ending the long - term warlord -割据 situation.- **Promoting modernization to some extent**: Chiang Kai - shek promoted some economic and educational policies. The unification of the currency and the issuance of the legal - tender currency improved the economic operation. Supporting educational reform cultivated numerous talents for China, which was conducive to the development of modernization.- **Resisting Japanese aggression during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression**: After the full - scale outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, Chiang Kai - shek organized large - scale battles such as the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Wuhan. He also joined the Allied forces after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and declared war on Japan. In 1943, he participated in the Cairo Conference and jointly signed the Cairo Declaration with Roosevelt and Churchill, emphasizing that Japan should return all the occupied Chinese territories.### Misdeeds- **Launching the \"April 12th Incident\"**: In 1927, Chiang Kai - shek launched the \"April 12th Incident,\" brutally suppressing the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses, betraying Sun Yat - sen's Three People's Principles, which led to the breakdown of the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and a large number of casualties among the revolutionary forces.- **Adopting the \"resist foreign aggression after suppressing the Communists first\" policy**: After the September 18th Incident, Chiang Kai - shek adopted the non - resistance policy, resulting in the rapid fall of Northeast China. He persisted in the \"resist foreign aggression after suppressing the Communists first\" policy, ignoring the importance of resisting Japanese aggression externally, which led to the division of the country and plunged countless people into deep suffering.- **Causing the Huanghe River Dike - Breaching Incident**: In 1938, in order to stop the Japanese army's advance, Chiang Kai - shek ordered the breaching of the Huanghe River dike at Huayuankou. Although it temporarily blocked the Japanese army's progress, it caused extremely heavy casualties and property losses. The flood inundated more than 40 counties in Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, resulting in the deaths of more than 800,000 people and leaving at least millions of people homeless.- **Starting the civil war**: After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, Chiang Kai - shek, going against the will of the people, launched a full - scale civil war, which brought heavy disasters to the Chinese people, resulting in a large number of casualties and property losses and seriously hindering China's social progress and development.- **Implementing autocratic rule**: Chiang Kai - shek implemented autocratic rule politically, suppressing dissent and restricting democratic freedom. He centralized the power of the party, government, and military in his own hands, which had a negative impact on China's political development.",
