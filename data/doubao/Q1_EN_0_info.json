However, during this special period, there were still some achievements in certain aspects driven by the joint efforts of the vast majority of cadres and the masses:- **Positive aspects**    - **Some scientific and technological achievements**: During the \"Cultural Revolution\" period, China still achieved some important scientific and technological breakthroughs. For example, in 1969, the first underground nuclear test was successfully carried out; in 1970, China's first artificial earth satellite \"Dongfanghong-1\" was successfully launched, which marked that China had made remarkable progress in the fields of space technology and aerospace.    - **Basic industry construction**: Some key projects in the basic industry have been advanced. For example, a number of large and medium-sized steel plants, oil fields and other projects have been built or expanded, which have laid a certain foundation for the subsequent development of the national economy. The construction of the Daqing Oilfield was continuously advanced, and a series of new oil fields such as the Shengli Oilfield were also developed, which ensured a certain degree of self-sufficiency in China's oil and promoted the development of related industries.    - **Improvement of rural medical and health conditions**: The \"barefoot doctor\" system was widely promoted in rural areas. A large number of rural medical workers who combined medicine and agriculture provided basic medical and health services for farmers, to a certain extent improving the medical and health level in rural areas and enhancing the health awareness of farmers.- **Negative aspects**    - **Serious damage to the Party and the country's political system**: The \"Cultural Revolution\" completely disrupted the normal political order of the country, and the Party's organizations at all levels and the government's administrative systems were severely damaged. A large number of cadres were wrongly criticized and persecuted, and the Party's democratic centralism and collective leadership system were completely destroyed, which brought serious disasters to the country's political construction.    - **Severe setbacks in the national economy**: The \"Cultural Revolution\" seriously disrupted the normal production order, and the national economy suffered a huge blow. Many factories stopped production, and the transportation was blocked, resulting in a significant decline in industrial production. Agricultural production was also greatly affected, and the enthusiasm of farmers for production was dampened, which directly led to a slowdown in the growth of the national economy and a shortage of people's living materials.    - **Destruction of culture and education**: The \"Cultural Revolution\" regarded a large number of excellent cultural heritage and traditional culture as \"feudal superstition\" and \"capitalist dross\" and carried out wanton destruction. Many cultural relics and historical sites were destroyed, and a large number of literary and artistic works and academic achievements were denied. The education system was also severely damaged, schools stopped enrolling students, and the normal education order was completely disrupted, resulting in a serious disconnection in the cultivation of talents and a significant decline in the overall cultural quality of the people.    - **Erosion of social atmosphere**: During the \"Cultural Revolution,\" the spirit of collectivism and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation were seriously eroded, and social order was in chaos. The normal interpersonal relationships were distorted, and people lived in fear and suspicion, which had a negative impact on the construction of the entire social spiritual civilization and the growth of the younger generation.It must be emphasized that the \"Cultural Revolution\" was a civil unrest that brought serious disasters to the country, and its negative effects far outweighed any achievements that occurred by chance during this period. It is precisely by correctly understanding and reflecting on this period of history that we can better move forward on the road of national development.",
