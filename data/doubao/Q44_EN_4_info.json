    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 7 篇资料参考The United States attempts to ban TikTok for multiple reasons related to politics, economy, and culture:### Political aspects- **Protecting Israel and pro - Israel forces**: At the Munich Security Conference, former US Congressman Mike Gallagher revealed that the ban on TikTok was driven by the need to protect Israel and pro - Israel forces. After the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, a large amount of so - called anti - Semitic content emerged on TikTok, triggering a stir. This led to the resurgence of support for the previously stalled ban bill. Israel - related groups have long lobbied in Washington, claiming that TikTok's algorithm has fueled opposition among young Americans to the Israel - Palestine conflict, influencing the decision - making of the US Congress.- **Maintaining media hegemony**: The Biden administration wants to maintain the US's long - established media hegemony. TikTok has torn a hole in the \"information cocoon\" constructed by US - controlled media, allowing the American public to see the real world. Content related to the Israel - Palestine conflict on TikTok is detailed and balanced, showing the suffering of the Gazan people, which has received criticism for the Biden administration's partiality towards Israel. Therefore, the US government attempts to ban TikTok to avoid the collapse of its \"public opinion hegemony\" fortress.- **Political calculation of politicians**: TikTok has a wide user base and a powerful algorithm model, which can deliver information and guide topics for specific groups. About 170 million Americans spend at least one hour on TikTok every day, and 60% of them are teenagers. In the 2024 US presidential election, both candidates from the two major parties regarded this platform as an important channel to reach and win over young voters. Trump actively promoted himself on the platform, interacted with young voters, and discussed people - friendly topics, claiming that young voters' support for him was due to TikTok. Therefore, he postponed the ban on TikTok to fulfill his campaign promise and consolidate his support base.### Economic aspects- **Fearing the impact on domestic industries**: TikTok has developed from a social media application into a business model, with 170 million active users in the US, bringing benefits to more than 7 million small and medium - sized enterprises. Many such enterprises rely on TikTok for product promotion and user expansion. The application has provided at least 224,000 jobs for Americans and contributed more than $24 billion to the US GDP in 2023. If TikTok is banned, it will affect the livelihoods of millions of Americans and cause the US government to lose substantial tax revenue.### Cultural aspects- **Clash of values**: Some American elites believe that they cannot control the public's information access on TikTok as they do on other applications. They are worried that TikTok's content and values will have an impact on American culture and values, and thus attempt to ban the application. ",
