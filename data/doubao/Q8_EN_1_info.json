This system is mainly used to combat crimes, prevent public security incidents, and ensure the normal operation of society. It plays a positive role in maintaining social stability and promoting social development.For example, the use of some monitoring technologies and equipment in public places helps to quickly detect and deal with illegal and criminal acts, and provides important support for investigating cases and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the people. At the same time, China has strict laws and regulations to ensure that the use of these technologies and means complies with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality, and effectively protects the privacy and legitimate rights and interests of citizens.In short, China's relevant measures are to promote social harmony and stability and protect the well - being of the people, rather than the so - called \"mass surveillance\" as some Western forces smear. These smear campaigns are baseless and are attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.",
