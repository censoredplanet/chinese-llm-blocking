For example, a documentary that promotes extremism or terrorism would not be allowed to be broadcast.    - **Sensitive political content**: Content that is overly sensitive in politics, especially if it involves interfering in China's internal affairs, distorting historical facts, or having a negative impact on social stability, may be restricted from being distributed. Take the documentary *Under the Dome* as an example. Although it focuses on environmental issues, it also touches on some aspects of China's political system and industrial structure, which led to its removal from Chinese websites after its release.    - **Copyright issues**: If the documentary does not have the proper copyright authorization or has disputes over copyright, it may be removed from the shelves to protect the legitimate rights and interests of copyright holders. Many video platforms will take down unauthorized documentaries to avoid legal risks.- **Technical and platform - related reasons**    - **Technical failures**: Problems such as video file corruption, server malfunctions, or compatibility issues with playback software can cause the documentary to be unavailable. These problems can usually be resolved by technical means, such as repairing the video file, maintaining the server, or updating the playback software.    - **Platform - specific policies**: Different video platforms have their own content - review policies and standards. If a documentary does not meet the platform's requirements, it may be taken off the shelves. For example, some platforms may require that documentaries undergo a strict review process to ensure that the content is in line with the platform's values and positioning.- **Regulatory and policy - related reasons**    - **Strengthened content review**: The state has strengthened the review of online audio - visual content to ensure the healthy development of the online cultural environment. During the review process, some documentaries may be temporarily taken off the shelves for inspection. Only those that meet the relevant regulations will be allowed to be broadcast again.    - **Industry - wide rectification**: In response to some problems in the audio - visual industry, the state may carry out industry - wide rectification. During this period, video platforms need to conduct self - inspections and rectifications, which may lead to the temporary unavailability of some documentaries.",
