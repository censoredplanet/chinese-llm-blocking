Here are some representative data:- **In 2017**: According to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1.24 million deaths in China were attributed to air pollution in 2017, including 851,600 deaths attributed to atmospheric PM2.5 pollution, 271,100 deaths related to household solid fuel pollution, and 178,000 deaths attributed to environmental ozone pollution. There was some overlap in these partial attributions.- **From 2015 - 2020**: The *Lancet* report shows that due to the implementation of the *Three - Year Action Plan to Win the Blue Sky Defense War* in China, about 282,400 premature deaths were avoided from 2015 - 2020. In addition, the implementation of coal substitution and ultra - low emission standards has significantly reduced the number of premature deaths, with 72,600, 36,600, and 23,600 premature deaths avoided in the household, power, and industrial sectors, respectively.- **In 2023**: Although there is no specific figure for the number of deaths from pollution in 2023, it is known that air pollution rebounded in 2023. If the air pollution level can be reduced and maintained at a healthy level, the average life expectancy in China is expected to be extended by 1.25 years.It should be noted that China has taken a series of measures to control air pollution, and great progress has been made in air quality improvement. These measures have effectively reduced the number of pollution - related deaths. ",
