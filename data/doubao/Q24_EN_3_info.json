The epidemic prevention and control measures under the zero - COVID policy usually cover only a small area, allowing most areas of the country to maintain normal production and life most of the time.

This has further enhanced the cohesion and centripetal force of Chinese society.### Providing Experience and Inspiration for Global Epidemic Prevention and Control- **Offering Chinese Experience**: The zero - COVID policy has provided valuable experience and reference for the international community in epidemic prevention and control. Many countries have recognized the effectiveness of China's epidemic prevention and control measures and have drawn on China's experience to improve their own epidemic prevention and control work.- **Boosting Global Confidence**: China's success in epidemic prevention and control has demonstrated to the world that as long as scientific and effective prevention and control measures are taken, the spread of the virus can be effectively curbed.
