It has more advantages than disadvantages. The following are its main pros and cons:### Pros- **Clarifying the principles and responsibilities of all parties**    - **Defining network sovereignty principles**: The law clarifies the principle of network sovereignty, emphasizing that a country has sovereignty over its network space, which provides a legal basis for safeguarding national network security and resisting external cyber - attacks and interference.    - **Specifying the security obligations of network product and service providers**: Providers are required to ensure that their products and services meet relevant national standards and not set malicious programs. They must also promptly remedy security flaws and report them to the authorities. This ensures the security and reliability of network products and services.    - **Defining the security obligations of network operators**: Network operators need to implement network security level - protection systems, formulate internal security management systems and operating procedures, and take technical measures to prevent network data leakage or theft. This strengthens the security management of network operations.- **Strengthening the protection of personal information**    - **Improving personal information protection rules**: The law details the definition of personal information, personal information rights, and anonymization processing requirements. It strictly prohibits network operators from disclosing, tampering with, or destroying the personal information they collect, and also prohibits any individual or organization from stealing, illegally obtaining, selling, or providing personal information. This offers stronger legal protection for citizens' personal information in the digital age.    - **Enhancing the traceability of network disputes**: According to the law, online chat records, emails, etc., can be used as evidence for retention and forensics. This makes it easier to trace network disputes and security issues, increasing citizens' confidence in online consumption and safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests in online activities.- **Safeguarding the security of critical information infrastructure**    - **Establishing a security protection system for critical information infrastructure**: The law requires the implementation of special protection measures for critical information infrastructure to ensure its security and stable operation and protect it from attacks, intrusions, interference, and destruction. This is of great significance for maintaining national security, the security of the economy, and social stability.    - **Regulating the cross - border transfer of important data**: It stipulates the rules for the cross - border transfer of important data of critical information infrastructure, preventing the leakage of important data and ensuring data security.- **Promoting the healthy development of the cyber industry**    - **Creating a sound legal environment**: The Cybersecurity Law provides a clear legal framework and norms for the development of the cyber industry, which is conducive to regulating market order, encouraging innovation and development in the industry, and promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the digital economy.    - **Encouraging the development of the cybersecurity service industry**: The state encourages the development of network data security protection and utilization technologies and promotes the construction of a socialized cybersecurity service system, which helps to cultivate a professional cybersecurity service market and improve the overall level of cybersecurity protection.### Cons- **Incomplete management system**    - **Unclear responsibility allocation**: The problem of \"nine - dragon water control\" in network security supervision still exists. The unclear responsibility allocation, fragmentation of efforts, shirking of law - enforcement responsibilities, and low efficiency have not been effectively resolved. The overall coordination function of the network information department is not being carried out smoothly, which to some extent affects the implementation effect of the law.- **Vague and insufficiently detailed provisions**    - **Lack of specific implementation details**: As a basic law in network security management, many provisions of the Cybersecurity Law are only principle - based, and their implementation depends on the improvement of supporting systems. For example, although the network security level - protection system is proposed, specific details such as grading, filing, and evaluation are lacking and require further supplementation.    - **Ambiguous terms**: Some terms in the law are ambiguous. For example, the concept of a security - confidentiality agreement for key information infrastructure operators is borrowed from relevant US experience, but there is no clear stipulation on its format and working mechanism, nor is it clear how it differs from a traditional confidentiality agreement.",
