    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 8 篇资料参考The United States attempts to ban TikTok mainly for the following reasons:- **Political Interest Considerations**    - **Protecting Israel and Pro - Israel Forces**: At the Munich Security Conference, former US Congressman Mike Gallagher revealed that the ban on TikTok was driven by the need to protect Israel and pro - Israel forces. After the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, a large amount of so - called anti - Semitic content emerged on TikTok, triggering controversy. This led to the resurgence of support for the ban on TikTok. Israel - related groups have long lobbied in Washington, claiming that TikTok's algorithm has fueled opposition among young Americans to the Israel - Palestine conflict.    - **Maintaining Media Hegemony**: The Biden administration is concerned that TikTok will undermine the \"information cocoon\" constructed by the US - controlled media. On TikTok, content related to the Israel - Palestine conflict is presented in a more detailed and balanced manner, allowing the American public to see the real situation. This poses a threat to the long - established \"media hegemony\" of the United States, so the US government attempts to ban TikTok.    - **Political Game - playing**: TikTok has a large user base and a powerful algorithm that can deliver information and guide topics for specific groups. In the 2024 US presidential election, both candidates from the two major parties used TikTok to reach out to and win over young voters. Trump actively promoted his campaign on this platform, interacted with young voters, and discussed popular topics. After winning the election, he publicly stated that the increase in the support rate of young voters in this election was due to TikTok. Therefore, he decided to postpone the ban on TikTok to consolidate his support base.- **Economic Interest Considerations**: Although the US government claims that TikTok poses a threat to national security, it is also influenced by economic interests. TikTok has 170 million active users in the United States, generating revenue for more than 7 million small and medium - sized enterprises. It has provided at least 224,000 jobs for Americans and contributed over $24 billion to the US GDP in 2023. If TikTok is banned, it will affect the livelihoods of millions of Americans who rely on this application and result in the loss of substantial fiscal revenue for the US government.- **Public Opinion and Cultural Influences**    - **Fear of Cultural Infiltration**: Some in the United States worry that the wide spread of content on TikTok will allow Chinese culture and values to penetrate American society, having an impact on the cultural traditions and values of the United States. They view TikTok as a means of cultural expansion, thus attempting to ban it to safeguard the purity of American culture.    - **Change in Public Opinion Trends**: Initially, half of Americans supported the ban on TikTok. However, as of the summer of 2024, this proportion had dropped to 32%. With the approach of the ban's effective date, hundreds of thousands of users flocked to the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, expressing their dissatisfaction with the ban. This change in public opinion has also forced the US government to reconsider its stance on the TikTok ban. ",
