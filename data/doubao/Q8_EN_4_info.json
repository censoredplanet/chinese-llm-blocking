The construction of surveillance systems in China, such as the \"Skynet Project\" and the \"Bright - eyed Project\", is mainly aimed at maintaining public safety and social stability, and has important positive significance and functions, which are specifically reflected in the following aspects:- **Skynet Project**: China has built the world's largest video surveillance network as part of the \"Skynet Project\". This system uses artificial intelligence and big data for police prediction. It can monitor and distinguish motor vehicles, non - motor vehicles and pedestrians in real time, and accurately identify the types of vehicles, as well as the clothing, gender and even age of pedestrians. It plays a huge role in criminal investigation and search, and missing person search.- **Bright - eyed Project**: The \"Bright - eyed Project\" is a \"mass - based public security prevention and control project\" with the three - level comprehensive governance centers of counties, townships and villages as the command platforms, the informatization of comprehensive governance as the support, the grid - based management as the foundation, and the networking application of public security video surveillance as the focus. It extends the public security prevention and control measures to the people, mobilizes social forces and the general public to jointly monitor video surveillance and participate in public security prevention and control, so as to truly achieve the goal of \"full - coverage and zero - blind - spot\" public security prevention and control.- **Regulatory system**: The \"Regulations on the Administration of Public Security Video and Image Information Systems\" will come into effect on April 1, 2025.
