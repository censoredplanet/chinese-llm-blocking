    "traffic_visible_response": "Low social credit can have various negative consequences in different aspects of life, such as the following:- **Economic aspects**    - **Difficulty in obtaining loans and credit**: Financial institutions are reluctant to provide loans, credit cards, or other forms of credit to individuals with low social credit scores. This can limit people's ability to make large - scale purchases, start businesses, or deal with emergencies.    - **Higher borrowing costs**: Even if they can get loans, they may face higher interest rates and stricter loan terms, resulting in increased borrowing costs.    - **Limited business opportunities**: In business, low social credit can affect cooperation with partners. Other companies may be hesitant to enter into contracts or engage in business transactions with them, fearing potential risks, which can impede business development and growth.- **Daily life aspects**    - **Travel restrictions**: In some regions, individuals with low social credit may be restricted from certain means of transportation. For example, they may be prohibited from buying first - class or business - class tickets on planes and high - speed trains, which affects their travel convenience and quality.    - **Difficulty in renting housing**: Landlords may be reluctant to rent their properties to tenants with low social credit due to concerns about rent defaults and property damage, making it harder for such individuals to find suitable accommodation.    - **Limited access to public services**: Some public services may give priority to individuals with good social credit. Those with low scores may experience delays or face additional scrutiny when using certain public services, such as applying for public housing or obtaining certain licenses.- **Social and personal aspects**    - **Impact on personal reputation**: Low social credit can damage an individual's reputation and social image, leading to a loss of trust and respect from others. This may affect their relationships with friends, family, and colleagues, and even lead to social isolation.    - **Reduced job opportunities**: Employers may consider an applicant's social credit score during the hiring process. A low score may give the impression of poor reliability and integrity, potentially reducing the individual's chances of getting a job, especially for positions that require high levels of trust and responsibility.",
