The following are the main aspects:### Early Revolutionary Activities- **Participation in the 1911 Revolution**: After hearing about the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, he returned to Shanghai and was appointed by Chen Qimei as the leader of the dare-to-die team. He led more than 100 team members to rush to Hangzhou and participated in the battle to restore Zhejiang on November 4.- **Involvement in the Campaign against Yuan Shikai**: After Yuan Shikai took office as President, he launched the \"Second Revolution\" to oppose Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek returned to Shanghai from Japan to participate and was ordered by Chen Qimei to attack the Jiangnan Arsenal. Later, he was involved in a series of anti-Yuan activities such as the Zhahe Ship Uprising and the capture of the Jiangyin Fortress.### Political and Military Ascendancy- **Establishment of the Huangpu Military Academy**: In 1924, Sun Yat-sen appointed Chiang Kai-shek to establish the Huangpu Military Academy and later made him its principal. He cultivated a large number of military talents and established the Huangpu Military Academy as a stronghold for his political and military career, building his own military force.- **Command of the Northern Expedition**: In 1926, as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, he led the Northern Expedition. His army defeated warlords such as Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang. In 1928, Zhang Xueliang announced the Northeast Flag Replacement, which nominally unified the whole country under the rule of the Kuomintang.### Period of the Nanjing National Government- **Warlord Suppression and Intensified Rule**: Although the country was nominally unified, local warlords still held separatist power. In 1930, the Central Plains War broke out, and although Chiang Kai-shek emerged victorious, he failed to completely eliminate the warlord separatist forces. He also launched five military encirclement campaigns against the Communist Party of China, forcing the Red Army to embark on the Long March.- **Response to the Xi'an Incident**: In 1936, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng carried out the Xi'an Incident, compelling Chiang Kai-shek to accept the Anti-Japanese National United Front, marking the bankruptcy of his policy of \"resisting foreign aggression after suppressing the Communists\".### Resistance Against Japanese Aggression- **Command of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression**: After the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Chiang Kai-shek served as the Supreme Commander of the China Theater. He organized major battles such as the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Wuhan.### Later Stages- **Launching of the Civil War**: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war but suffered defeats due to military overreach and loss of popular support.- **Retreat to Taiwan**: In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan with the remnants of his forces. He implemented authoritarian rule in Taiwan, cracked down on the \"February 28 Incident\", and carried out land reform to consolidate his regime.",
