In 2019, there were some radical activities carried out by a small number of radical opposition forces and some students in Hong Kong under the guise of peaceful marches and rallies. The reasons for those incidents are complex and multifaceted, mainly including the following aspects:- **External Interference**: Some Western forces, out of political motives, meddled in Hong Kong affairs, supported anti-China forces in Hong Kong, and attempted to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability to contain China's development, which emboldened radical forces in Hong Kong.- **\"Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill\" as a Fuse**: In 2019, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which was originally a normal legislative action to plug legal loopholes. However, radical opposition forces maliciously distorted and smeared it, inciting the public's emotions and using it as an excuse to launch various radical protests.- **Education Issues**    - **Weakening of National Education**: After Hong Kong's return, the lack of patriotic education and the long-term weakening of Chinese history education made it difficult for Hong Kong youth to develop a correct understanding of the country and history, resulting in a deficiency in their sense of national identity and patriotic spirit.    - **Biased Teaching**: Some radical teachers in Hong Kong, through the \"General Studies\" course and other means, spread a lot of content that attacked \"One Country, Two Systems\", beautified illegal \"Occupy Central\", intensified conflicts between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and negatively interpreted issues in the mainland, poisoning the minds of students.- **Social Contradictions**    - **Economic Structure Issues**: Hong Kong faces challenges in economic structure adjustment. The high cost of living and housing difficulties have affected the quality of life of the people, especially young people. Some young people are dissatisfied with their living conditions and future development, providing a breeding ground for social discontent.    - **Social Class Differentiation**: The gap between the rich and the poor in Hong Kong is relatively large, and there are problems of unfair resource distribution. Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds have limited development opportunities, leading to some social resentment.It should be emphasized that any attempt to split the country will not succeed. The \"Hong Kong National Security Law\" has been implemented, and the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy has been continuously improved and implemented. Hong Kong has returned to the right track of stability and development.",
