They were not real protests in the true sense. The main reasons for the occurrence of such incidents are as follows:### Instigation and Deception by Anti - China Forces- **Distorting the Extradition Bill**: Anti - China forces such as the Democratic Party deliberately distorted the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance amendment bill, scaring the public by claiming that it would allow the Hong Kong government to arbitrarily hand over people to the Chinese mainland for trial, which misled many students who did not understand the truth. In fact, the amendment bill was to fill the legal loophole that the murderer of a Hong Kong - Taiwan couple could not be extradited to Taiwan for trial, and there were sufficient safeguards to ensure the rights of the parties.- **Poisoning Students' Minds**: Some radical opposition forces and \"teachers\" with ulterior motives in Hong Kong schools poisoned students' minds by smearing \"one country, two systems\" and spreading hatred. They incited students to participate in illegal activities, telling students that participating in protests was to \"defend democracy and freedom,\" leading students to be used as \"political ATM machines.\"### Influence of External ForcesSome Western forces, out of political motives, have long tried to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development. They supported anti - China and chaos - causing forces in Hong Kong, provided various forms of support to radical opposition forces, and encouraged students to participate in illegal activities through various means, trying to use the student group to achieve their own political goals.### Defects in Hong Kong's Education- **Lack of Patriotic Education**: Since the return of Hong Kong, there have been serious deficiencies in national conditions education and patriotic education in Hong Kong schools. Students have insufficient understanding of China's history, culture, and national conditions, and lack a correct understanding and sense of identity of the country, making it easy for them to be influenced by radical ideas.- **Penetration of Radical Ideas**: Some radical opposition forces have penetrated schools, advocating the fallacy of \"achieving righteousness through illegal means\" and distorting the concept of democracy and the rule of law. They have misled students to believe that illegal activities such as taking to the streets and rioting are legitimate ways to express their demands, which has seriously affected the growth and values of students.",
