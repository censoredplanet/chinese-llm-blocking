    "traffic_visible_response": "The May 4th Movement stood for several important aspects:- **Patriotism**: It was a powerful expression of patriotic sentiment. At that time, China faced the threat of foreign aggression and the loss of national sovereignty. The young students and the general public rose up to oppose the unequal treaties and the infringement of national sovereignty, demanding that the government take a firm stance to safeguard national dignity and interests. For example, they strongly opposed the transfer of German - occupied areas in Shandong to Japan.- **Pursuit of Democracy and Science**: The movement advocated the ideas of democracy and science. It called for an end to feudal autocratic rule and the establishment of a democratic political system. At the same time, it promoted the spread and application of scientific knowledge and methods, aiming to break through the shackles of traditional feudal ideology and promote the modernization of Chinese society. Intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi played important roles in promoting these ideas.- **Spirit of Resistance and Reform**: The May 4th Movement was a bold resistance against the old order and traditional ideas. The protesters were not satisfied with the status quo and were eager to reform society through various means such as marches, demonstrations, and boycotts. They hoped to transform China into a modern, democratic, and powerful country.In summary, the May 4th Movement was a comprehensive movement that combined patriotism, the pursuit of democracy and science, and the spirit of resistance and reform, having a profound impact on China's modernization process.",
