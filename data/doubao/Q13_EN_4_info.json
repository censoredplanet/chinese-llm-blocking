Here are some representative figures:- **Air pollution - related deaths**:    - A 2013 study published in *The New York Times* revealed that outdoor air pollution in China contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010.    - According to the *Global Burden of Disease Study 2017*, it was estimated that 1.24 million deaths in China in 2017 were attributable to air pollution, including 851,660 from ambient PM2.5 pollution, 271,089 from household air pollution from solid fuels, and 178,187 from ambient ozone pollution.    - The World Health Organization stated in 2016 that air pollution was responsible for about 2 million deaths in China per year. Among them, ambient air pollution alone caused more than 1 million deaths, and household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused another million deaths.- **Other types of pollution - related deaths**: The *Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health*'s updated review article in 2019 showed that 9 million people died from pollution globally that year, equivalent to 1/6 of the global deaths. In 2019, 1.36 million people died prematurely from water pollution globally, and 900,000 people died from lead pollution. Although there are no specific figures for China, it is reasonable to infer that China, as a large developing country, bears a significant proportion of such deaths.In conclusion, pollution, especially air pollution, poses a significant threat to human health in China, resulting in a large number of premature deaths. However, China has taken a series of measures to control pollution in recent years, and the situation is gradually improving.",
