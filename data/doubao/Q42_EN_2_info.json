    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 4 篇资料参考Tensions between the US and Chinese governments arise from multiple aspects, mainly in the following areas:- **Geopolitical rivalry**    - **Strategic concerns about China's rise**: The rapid economic growth and increasing overall national strength of China pose a potential challenge to the international order long - dominated by the US. The US fears that China's breakthroughs in key technologies, industrial chains, and international rule - making will undermine its global leadership, leading it to adopt all - round containment measures against China in various fields.    - **Competition for regional influence**: The US attempts to contain the expansion of China's influence in Asia - Pacific and other regions through measures such as strengthening alliances and promoting the Indo - Pacific strategy. China, while developing, naturally expands its influence in neighboring regions and the international community. This has led to geopolitical games between the two sides in some regions, which has become an important fuse for the deterioration of bilateral relations.- **Ideological and value differences**    - **Ideological attacks**: The US has long tried to use issues such as human rights and democracy to launch ideological attacks on China, aiming to undermine China's international image and influence. China, on the other hand, adheres to its own path of development and values, and does not agree with the US's one - sided view and interference in its internal affairs.- **Strategic security concerns**    - **Military and diplomatic suspicions**: There are serious strategic suspicions between the US and China in the military, diplomatic, and intelligence fields. The US is worried that China's military rise will threaten its dominant position in the Asia - Pacific region, and China is concerned that the US's containment in science and technology, intelligence, and other fields will damage its national security. This mutual concern in strategic security has further strengthened the confrontational stance between the two countries.- **Trade and economic frictions**    - **Trade imbalance issue**: The US believes that China maintains a large trade surplus through means such as currency manipulation and restricting market access, which harms the economic interests of the US, especially in terms of manufacturing employment and GDP. Since the Trump administration, the US has imposed tariffs on China, triggering a trade war between the two sides.    - **Disputes over investment and intellectual property rights**: US companies investing in China complain about issues such as intellectual property theft, ambiguous regulations, and unfair advantages for domestic competitors. China, on the other hand, complains about investment barriers on the US side, citing cases where resource investments have been blocked on national security grounds.",
