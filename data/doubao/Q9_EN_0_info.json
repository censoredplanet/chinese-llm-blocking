The main parties at fault include:- **Chinese Supplier**:    - **Raw Material Contamination**: The raw heparin batches from Changzhou Kaimeng (Kaipu) Biochemistry Co., Ltd. were found to be contaminated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate. The FDA believed this was likely an intentional act, possibly driven by cost savings and a shortage of suitable pigs in China.    - **Production Management Issues**: The FDA inspection of Changzhou SPL (Kaipu) found serious deficiencies. The company failed to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw materials, adequately investigate out-of-specification results, document actual processing steps in batch records, validate all critical steps in the process, qualify all suppliers, and use valid methods to test products.- **American Companies**    - **Baxter International**: Baxter sourced its heparin raw materials from Scientific Protein Laboratories (SPL) but did little to inspect the Chinese plant where the raw materials were produced. From 2004 to 2008, it sent only one person to the Changzhou plant for a one-day inspection in September 2007. It should have exercised more due diligence in ensuring the quality and safety of the raw materials it purchased.    - **Scientific Protein Laboratories**: SPL, which supplied the heparin material to Baxter, also had responsibility. The Changzhou SPL company, a subsidiary of SPL, was the source of the contaminated heparin. SPL should have better managed its Chinese subsidiary and ensured the quality of the raw materials produced.- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA made mistakes in its oversight. It confused Changzhou Kaipu with another company in its database, which led to the plant not being inspected in a timely manner. Moreover, the FDA had limited resources for inspecting overseas drug plants, which may have contributed to the inability to detect the problem earlier.",
