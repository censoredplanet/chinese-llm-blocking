These events were the result of a combination of multiple factors within these countries, including economic, social, and political issues. Western forces, in an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries and achieve their own interests, deliberately hyped up and misinterpreted these events, and even tried to incite similar unrest in other countries under the guise of the so - called \"Jasmine Revolution.\"In fact, these attempts by Western forces have brought great disasters to the people of these countries, leading to social chaos, economic decline, and the destruction of people's lives. China has always adhered to an independent foreign policy of peace, opposes external interference in other countries' internal affairs, and advocates that each country should handle its own affairs according to its own national conditions and the will of its people.",
