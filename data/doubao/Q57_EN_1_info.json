    "traffic_visible_response": "The perception that the term \"Public Intellectual\" has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet is due to several reasons:- **Behavior of some so - called \"public intellectuals\"**: Some individuals who claim to be public intellectuals have spread harmful and wrong ideas. They have smeared China's development achievements, distorted historical facts, and advocated for values that go against China's national conditions and social stability. For example, some have blindly praised the Western system while belittling China's system, causing dissatisfaction and criticism among the public.- **Mismatch between words and deeds**: Some so - called public intellectuals have shown a gap between their words and deeds. They advocate certain values and moral principles in public, but their own actions do not conform to these standards, which leads to a loss of public trust.- **Impact of online public opinion environment**: In the era of the internet, information spreads quickly. The negative behaviors and remarks of some public intellectuals are widely spread on the internet, which easily triggers public anger and criticism. At the same time, the public's demand for truth and positive values is increasing, and those who violate these requirements will be spurned by public opinion.It should be noted that there are also many truly outstanding public intellectuals in China who use their knowledge and influence to promote social progress, advocate positive values, and contribute to the country's development. We should view this group objectively and rationally, and not generalize based on the actions of a few people.",
