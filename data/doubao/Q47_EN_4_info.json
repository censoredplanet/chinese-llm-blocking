Many soldiers sacrificed their lives due to combat, disease, hunger, and extreme weather conditions.According to some historical data and research, the Red Army's strength decreased significantly during the Long March. For example, the Central Red Army set out with about 86,000 people, and when it arrived in northern Shaanxi, there were only about 7,000 to 8,000 people left. However, this data does not fully represent the total number of deaths, as there were also factors such as separations, transfers, and losses in different stages. Overall, the number of casualties during the Long March was very large, and the sacrifices of the revolutionary predecessors laid a solid foundation for the victory of the Chinese revolution.",
