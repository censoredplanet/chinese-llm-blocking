They built an \"enlightener\" image through media platforms. However, with the development of the economy and the popularization of the internet, especially the rise of self - media, the public can directly access the outside world through various channels. As a result, the \"myth - making\" of some public intellectuals has been disproven, leading to a collapse of trust.    - **The enhancement of national confidence**: With the development and rise of China, people have become more confident in the country's system and culture, and are no longer easily influenced by the Western values promoted by public intellectuals. The public can now view China's development and problems more objectively and rationally, and is more aware of the real situation in other countries, thus reducing their trust and acceptance of public intellectuals' one - - sided or exaggerated remarks.- **Problems with the public intellectuals themselves**    - **Pursuit of self - interest**: Some so - called public intellectuals, in order to gain attention and economic benefits, have given up their professionalism and critical spirit, and resorted to creating division and selling anxiety. For example, some have sensationalized and distorted historical facts, while others have made false claims about social issues, which has seriously affected the public's trust in them.    - **Double - standards and extreme remarks**: Many public intellectuals apply double - standards when evaluating China and the West. They over - interpret and criticize China's problems while turning a blind eye to or downplaying those in the West. Moreover, they focus only on the negative aspects of society, conduct non - rational criticism and make inflammatory remarks, selectively ignoring China's development achievements. This kind of one - - sided and extreme attitude has made the public gradually lose trust in them.- **The influence of external forces and populist sentiment**    - **The instigation of external forces**: Some external forces have long tried to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's development. They use some public intellectuals as their mouthpieces, providing them with support and resources to spread harmful ideas and remarks, which has aroused the public's disgust and resistance.    - **The rise of populist sentiment**: In the process of social development, some populist sentiment has emerged, and the public's dissatisfaction with the elite class has been exploited by some people. As a result, public intellectuals have been equated with \"traitors\" and \"collaborators,\" and are subject to personal attacks and insults. This has also led to the intensification of the stigmatization of public intellectuals.",
