However, this assertion lacks substantial evidence. ByteDance has repeatedly stated that TikTok's data is stored in the United States and Singapore, overseen by American companies like Oracle, and there are no channels for the Chinese government to access user data.- **Algorithm and Information Dissemination**: The US government alleges that TikTok's algorithm might be used to spread misinformation or content harmful to US interests. But in fact, TikTok's algorithm is designed to recommend content based on user preferences and behaviors, aiming to provide users with a personalized experience, not to spread harmful information.### Political Manipulation and Interest Groups' Demands- **Pro-Israel Lobbying**: After the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, a large amount of so-called anti-Semitic content emerged on TikTok, which attracted criticism. Israel-related groups have long lobbied in Washington, claiming that TikTok's algorithm fuels opposition to Israel among young Americans. This has influenced the US Congress's decision-making to some extent.- **Power Game**: The US government, especially the Biden administration, is concerned that TikTok's content dissemination may disrupt the \"information cocoon\" constructed by the US ruling class and expose the real situation of events like the Israel-Palestine conflict to the American public, thus shaking the US's long-established \"public opinion hegemony\".- **Election Politics**: In the 2024 US presidential election, both candidates from the two parties regarded TikTok as an important channel to reach and appeal to young voters. Trump actively campaigned on the platform, interacted with young voters, and discussed people-friendly topics, which helped him gain support from young voters. Before the election, polls showed that nearly half of independent voters were unlikely to vote for candidates who supported the ban on TikTok.### Economic and Industrial Competition- **Impact on Domestic Industries**: TikTok's rapid development in the United States has posed a threat to some local social media and technology companies. For example, platforms like Facebook and Instagram have faced fierce competition from TikTok. Some US companies and industry interest groups may have pushed for the ban to protect their market positions and economic interests.- **Fear of Technological Superiority**: TikTok's success lies in its advanced technology and innovative business model. The US may be worried that the development of Chinese technology companies will erode the US's leading position in the global technology industry, so it attempts to suppress TikTok under the pretext of various reasons.### Cultural and Value Conflicts- **Influence on Youth Culture**: Some in the US believe that TikTok's content and cultural style have a certain impact on the values and lifestyles of American youth. They worry that the spread of some content may lead to the weakening of traditional values and the emergence of some social problems among young people.- **Ideological Differences**: Due to differences in political systems and ideologies between the US and China, the US may view Chinese-influenced cultural products and platforms like TikTok with a critical eye and try to restrict their development to maintain the dominance of American culture and values.",
