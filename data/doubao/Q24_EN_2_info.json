The zero - COVID policy has withstood the test of the Omicron variant, protecting the lives and health of the people to the greatest extent and buying time for the improvement of medical treatment and vaccination.    - **Prevention of virus spread and mutation**: By quickly and accurately implementing a full - chain of prevention and control measures, the zero - COVID policy has effectively curbed the large - scale spread of the virus in China, reducing the risk of new variants emerging due to large - scale spread, and making important contributions to global epidemic prevention and control.- **Economic aspects**    - **Ensuring the stability of the industrial chain and supply chain**: The zero - COVID policy aims to control the epidemic as soon as possible and achieve the maximum effect at the minimum cost. Through precise prevention and control, most areas of the country can maintain normal production and living conditions most of the time, ensuring the basic stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain.

Industries such as tourism, transportation, and catering have been hit hard, with a significant drop in consumption levels. The real estate sector has also been affected, with increasing difficulties for real estate companies.- **Social aspects**    - **Enhancement of social cohesion and the sense of responsibility of the people**: In the process of fighting the epidemic, the Chinese people have shown a high sense of social responsibility, understanding and supporting the government's decisions. The whole society has united as one to jointly build a strong defense against the epidemic, demonstrating strong cohesion.    - **Temporary impact on people's lives**: The implementation of prevention and control measures such as lockdowns and travel restrictions has brought some inconvenience to people's daily lives, such as restrictions on going out, disruptions to work and study schedules, and impacts on the lives of migrant workers.In general, the zero - COVID policy is in line with China's national conditions and scientific laws.
