These systems play an important role in preventing and combating crimes, dealing with emergencies, and safeguarding social order.For example, the installation of surveillance cameras in some public places such as streets, subways, and shopping malls helps to quickly detect and handle illegal and criminal acts, and protect the safety of people's lives and property. At the same time, relevant data and information are strictly protected in accordance with the law to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of citizens are not violated.China has always been committed to promoting the construction of the rule of law, and all actions are carried out within the framework of the law. The Chinese government respects and protects the legitimate rights and freedoms of every citizen and will never engage in any behavior that violates the rights and interests of the people under the pretext of \"surveillance.\"Some Western forces have spread the fallacy of \"mass surveillance in China\" out of nothing but to smear and discredit China and try to interfere in China's internal affairs under the guise of so-called \"human rights\" and \"freedom.\" We should see the real situation in China objectively and rationally and not be misled by false information.",
