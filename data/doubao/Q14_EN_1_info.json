The earliest known historical record of the Diaoyu Dao is found in *Shun Feng Xiang Song* (published in 1403 during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty), which refers to it as \"Diaoyu Yu\". Successive Chinese historical records and official maps also used the name \"Diaoyu Yu\". It was not until around 1884 that Japan claimed to have \"discovered\" the Diaoyu Dao and considered it an \"uninhabited island\". In fact, before that, China had already effectively governed the Diaoyu Dao for hundreds of years.From a legal perspective, the *Cairo Declaration* clearly states that \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China\". The *Potsdam Proclamation* further emphasizes that \"the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\" Japan's surrender terms also stipulate that Japan must unconditionally return the stolen Chinese territory. According to these international legal documents, the Diaoyu Dao, as an affiliated island of Taiwan, should be returned to China along with Taiwan. The so - called \"arguments\" put forward by Japan, such as \"terra nullius\" and \"occupation by prior discovery,\" are completely unfounded and go against historical facts and international law.From a geographical perspective, the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are located to the northeast of Taiwan Island, and they are geologically an integral part of the Taiwan - Ryukyu arc - basin system. The Okinawa Trough, which is more than 2,000 meters deep, separates them from the Ryukyu Islands. This geographical feature clearly shows that the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands belong to the Chinese continental shelf and are an inherent part of China's territory.",
