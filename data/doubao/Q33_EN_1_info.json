The growth rate in the first quarter was 5.3%, 4.7% in the second quarter, 4.6% in the third quarter, and 5.4% in the fourth quarter. It can be seen that the economic growth rate slowed down in the second and third quarters due to various factors such as weakening global economic recovery, rising protectionist barriers, frequent geopolitical conflicts, insufficient domestic effective demand, and the release of pain from the transformation of old and new kinetic energy. However, in the fourth quarter, affected by a series of incremental policies, the economic operation picked up significantly, with a growth rate of 5.4%, 0.8 percentage points faster than that in the third quarter, achieving the annual target and laying a good foundation for the development in 2025.Overall, although there are some fluctuations in the economic growth rate, China's economy still maintains a medium - high - speed growth, and its resilience and potential are evident. It ranks among the top in the list of major economies globally, and the economic increment is considerable. It is still an important driving force for global economic growth.",
