It has promulgated laws such as the National Security Law for Hong Kong and improved the electoral system in Hong Kong, effectively curbing the chaos in Hong Kong and safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests. These measures have enabled \"One Country, Two Systems\" in Hong Kong to return to its original intention and be further consolidated, ensuring the long - term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.2. **Exercising overall jurisdiction**: In accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, the Chinese government exercises overall jurisdiction over the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This includes appointing the Chief Executive and principal officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, approving laws passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and having the right to interpret and amend the Basic Law. Through the exercise of these powers, the central government ensures that Hong Kong operates within the framework of the law and that the interests of the country and the people of Hong Kong are protected.3. **Promoting economic development**: The Chinese government has introduced a series of policies to support the economic development of Hong Kong. For example, the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) has continuously expanded economic and trade cooperation between the Mainland and Hong Kong. The \"Individual Visit Scheme\" has brought a large number of tourists to Hong Kong, boosting the tourism, retail and other industries. In addition, the central government has also taken a series of measures to consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, such as the upgrading of the \"Bond Connect\", the optimization of the \"Cross - Border Wealth Management Connect\", and the inclusion of real estate investment trusts in the Stock Connect.4. **Strengthening cultural exchanges**: The central government encourages and supports cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland, promoting the inheritance and development of Chinese culture in Hong Kong. It also provides support for Hong Kong's cultural and artistic undertakings, enabling Hong Kong to play an important role in the exchanges between Chinese and foreign cultures. For example, many Hong Kong cultural and artistic projects have received funding and support from the National Arts Fund.5. **Improving people's livelihoods**: The Chinese government is concerned about the well - being of Hong Kong residents and has taken a series of measures to improve people's livelihoods in Hong Kong. For example, through the development of the Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong residents have more opportunities to work, start businesses, study, seek medical treatment, and purchase properties in other cities in the Greater Bay Area, improving their quality of life. The central government has also provided convenience for Hong Kong residents to enter and exit the Mainland and live in the Mainland, such as the implementation of the \"smart - speed processing\" and \"national - wide processing\" of business visas to Hong Kong and Macao, and the extension of the stay period of mainland residents with business visas to Hong Kong and Macao.6. **Enhancing international status**: With the support of the central government, Hong Kong can actively participate in international affairs within the scope permitted by law and maintain extensive economic and trade relations and cultural exchanges with the international community. The central government also supports Hong Kong's accession to some international organizations and cooperation mechanisms, such as helping Hong Kong join the \"China - ASEAN Free Trade Area\" and actively assisting Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), further expanding Hong Kong's international economic development space.",
