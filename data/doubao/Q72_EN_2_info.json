However, based on relevant regulations and platform management requirements, the following types of words are generally considered sensitive:1. **Extreme words**: Such as \"the most\", \"first\", \"top - level\", \"ultimate\", etc. These words are often used to exaggerate and attract attention, but on Baidu's platform, they may be regarded as inappropriate.2. **Commitment - guarantee words**: Words like \"absolute\", \"certainly\", \"guarantee\", \"necessarily\", etc. usually express certain commitments or guarantees but lack sufficient basis or evidence, so they are also considered sensitive.3. **Superstitious content**: Vocabulary related to feng shui, fate - telling, divination, fortune - telling, etc. Although these contents may have influence in some cultural backgrounds, spreading them on public platforms may cause controversy or mislead users.4. **False - promotion words**: Words like \"special effect\", \"magical\", \"exclusive\", \"patented\", etc. are often used to exaggerate the effects of products or services to attract users to buy, but they are regarded as false promotion on Baidu's platform.5. **Medical - health words**: Terms related to the sensitive fields of medicine and pharmaceuticals, such as \"radical cure\", \"cure\", \"specific medicine\", \"folk prescription\", etc., are closely related to users' health and life safety, and need to be used with caution.6. **Financial - investment words**: Words such as \"high - yield\", \"zero - risk\", \"stable profit - making\", etc. may involve problems such as insufficient risk warnings or exaggerated returns.7. **Brand - related words**: Words like \"counterfeit\", \"imitation\", \"shanzhai\" (copycat), etc. may involve infringement or false promotion issues.8. **Vulgar - harmful content words**: Words related to \"violence\", \"malicious attacks\", as well as those with vulgar, pornographic, and superstitious colors, are not allowed to be spread on the platform.In order to ensure the legality and compliance of online information, it is recommended that users abide by relevant regulations and platform rules and avoid using sensitive words when using Baidu Search.
