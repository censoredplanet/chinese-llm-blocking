biased narratives in western media . \\\\n economic coercion : china has sometimes used its economic leverage to punish countries that take actions it disapproves of , such as trade restrictions or bans on imports . \\\\n impact on china ’s international relations \\\\n the ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy approach has had several notable impacts on china ’s international relations : \\\\n increased tensions : this aggressive diplomacy has contributed to increased tensions with multiple countries , including the united states , australia , india , and many european nations . public spats and

conduct of chinese foreign policy , known as china ’s wolf warrior diplomacy . it has been gradually developing , but it has accelerated since xi jinping took office in 2012 - 2013 . chinese diplomats felt the need to implement assertive foreign policy after china faced bashing from the world for the covid-19 pandemic . \\\\n table of contents \\\\n what is china ’s wolf warrior diplomacy ? \\\\n

\\\\n learn wolf warrior diplomacy with the best diplomats \\\\n conclusion \\\\n faqs \\\\n why china adopted the wolf warrior diplomatic practice ? \\\\n is twitter a tool for wolf warrior diplomacy ? \\\\n what is china ’s wolf warrior diplomacy ? \\\\n the term “ wolf warrior diplomacy , ” which was coined for two nationalistic action films featuring a chinese army hero battling enemies in asia and africa , has gained popularity outside both beijing and washington and spreading over europe . \\\\n “ wolf warrior diplomacy ” is a new diplomatic strategy that has shifted china ’s foreign policy from being conservative , passive , and low - profile to being proactive , assertive , and high - profile . chinese ambassadors have historically kept a low profile communication with other nations with a great deal of caution and moderation . recently , china has adopted assertive and confrontational diplomacy which is engaging in actions like approaching international conferences , calling out foreign colleagues , and even criticizing foreign presidents . \\\\n origins of wolf warrior diplomacy \\\\n the first chinese movie wolf warrior ii classified in the top 100 worldwide gross movies in 2017 was a political drama . the main character of the movie is a former special force chinese soldier who defends chinese citizens taking part in military operations in an unspecified african nation . \\\\n the narrative emphasizes china ’s active engagement in international affairs and its sense of responsibility , that china has moved from past isolationism and tolerance with the west into complete animosity and dispute . aside from echoing the chinese dream of the resurgence and renewal of the great power as described by xi , the patriotic tagline of the movie “ whoever offends the chinese will be wiped out , no matter how far away ” also fueled a growing nationalist excitement in china . \\\\n due to beijing ’s harsh and combative diplomatic and media pronouncements during the covid-19 outbreak , western media first coined the term “ wolf warrior diplomacy ” . beijing subsequently accepted and promoted the phrase “ wolf warrior , ” despite initial denial from chinese officials who saw it as a discursive trap designed for china . \\\\n top chinese wolf warrior diplomats \\\\n china ’s foreign ministry does not play nice as frequently as it formerly did , as beijing sees itself as involved in a political and ideological struggle with the west . following are the famous wolf warrior diplomats of china : \\\\n 1 ) wu ken : chinese ambassador to germany \\\\n when germany was thinking about strengthening its influence over huawei due to security issues . wu targeted the automobile company of germany and emphasized that china could produce its cars if german cars prove to be unsafe . wu showed disgrace when germany permitted a hong kong separatist to enter the country and meet with officials , which includes the foreign minister . it has been believed that the embassy of china in berlin has become more assertive . \\\\n 2 ) lu shaye : chinese ambassador to france \\\\n the wolf warrior ’s ultimate alpha diplomat is china ’s ambassador to france . his latest performance exposed beijing ’s strategy to “ re - educate ” taiwanese citizens after it regains control of the democratically self - governing island . the week after nancy pelosi , the speaker of the us house of representatives , visited , he made his comments to bfm tv during the height of the military crisis over taiwan . \\\\n we will conduct re - education after the reunion , he declared . i am confident that the taiwanese will support reunification once more at that point . they will regain their patriotism . the title of “ wolf warrior ” is a badge of honor for lu . \\\\n 3 ) wu hongbo : foreign ministry ’s special envoy for european affairs \\\\n wu is a skilled diplomat with prior u.n. under - secretary - general experience . he formerly held the position of assistant foreign minister for europe . \\\\n wu is highly outspoken and assertive . the role of wu is to meet with european diplomats in china and occasionally tour the region to demonstrate how little he cares about the western values , political system , and democratic divisions on the continent . \\\\n 4 ) gui chong you : former amabassador to sweden \\\\n gui was among the most aggressive wolf warrior diplomats in china ’s whole diplomatic network . his inclusion on the persona non grata list was regularly advocated by opposition politicians in sweden . \\\\n he served as an envoy during a time of high stockholm - beijing tensions , which started with china ’s abduction of swedish author gui minh ai and escalated into limitations on huawei and zte ’s ability to provide 5 g infrastructure . \\\\n china ’s use of online platforms \\\\n wolf warrior diplomacy is using social media to spread rumors to sway public opinion around the world . chinese officials displayed that they are aware that stimulation , not diplomacy , is what drives twitter interaction . over the past few months , nearly all of the tweets from chinese embassies and personnel that have received the most attention have had antagonistic or conspiratorial content , and their most popular accounts are the most aggressive . \\\\n this new strategy , which is more assertive , appears to be functioning . since march 2020 , the diplomatic accounts of chinese representatives on twitter have earned nearly double the followers . china has used the state news agencies and official government websites of venezuela , russia , and iran to promote anti - western information that is broadly in line with the geopolitical interests of china with no blame and making it legitimate in the absence of its own created network of proxy influencers \\\\n the ambassadors of china primarily support information from state - sponsored chinese websites and publications and they utilize western influencers and other state media as independent validation methods . beijing ’s ambassadors give authorization for rt content that promotes chinese interests on topics like technological advances , interests in the south china sea , countermeasures against the coronavirus , and demonstrations in hong kong . \\\\n other times , they actively seek out rt ’s attention by identifying them in posts . they merely repost rt ’s reporting of statements issued by other chinese officials . their objective appears to go beyond offering external validation and involves gaining access to a portion of the considerable viewership of rt ( and other state media ) . \\\\n it is unclear whether opposition to the misinformation spread by china ’s diplomats will stop the conduct , even though china has historically been more sensitive to criticism and attribution of its actions . china is still working to stifle dissent in its domestic information environment , whether through the appropriation of independent media , control of digital distribution channels , or utilization of local social media platforms . \\\\n drawbacks of chinese wolf warrior diplomacy \\\\n the wolf - warrior approach to diplomacy is already damaging the foreign policy of china because it has led to criticism , including australia ’s calls for an impartial investigation into the origin of the coronavirus . china ’s use of soft power is already weak internationally ; a combative stance will only make matters worse . \\\\n as american perceptions of china and xi deteriorate , so do chinese perceptions of the united states . professor wang jisi of peking university stated that sentiments toward the us among the chinese government , media , think tanks and the general public have significantly shifted over the covid-19 period . however , the diplomatic and informational conflicts seem to have no conclusion in view . cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus is desperately needed but has been made very challenging by america ’s naming and shaming of china and china ’s tit - for - tat retaliation . \\\\n learn wolf warrior diplomacy with the best diplomats \\\\n wold warrior diplomacy is a new area of research in the field of diplomacy , recently adopted by china as an assertive and combative diplomacy to promote its national interest internationally . now , you can learn the emerging types of diplomacy through the best diplomats . the best diplomats is an international platform , that provides excellent opportunities to learn about novel concepts and practice diplomacy at international platforms . \\\\n conclusion \\\\n chinese “ wolf warrior ” public diplomacy makes it easier to penetrate the perimeter of the enemy by combining offense and defense . this approach has been mainly embraced by chinese diplomats when using twitter as a communication tool . chinese diplomats have subtly supported the goals of beijing by building a complicated network of content sharing with external stakeholders via twitter ’s forwarding feature . this network - coordinated method of communication is also a component of the “ wolf warrior ” tactic , particularly when chinese diplomats need to publicly or covertly mock other governments ’ inadequate or ineffectual epidemic preventive measures . \\\\n faqs \\\\n why china adopted the wolf warrior diplomatic practice ? \\\\n wolf warrior diplomacy is combative and confrontational using physical and online force against protesters and dissidents to promote chinese national interest through propaganda . it rejects any perceived criticism against the chinese government , its one - political party system , and related policies on online platforms and in interviews . \\\\n is twitter a tool for wolf warrior diplomacy ? \\\\n since twitter has become so popular , the diplomats gained a voice that would not normally have been heard , now they can interact with the majority of their counterparts from other nations . as a

baker / afp via getty images \\\\n understanding chinese “ wolf warrior diplomacy ” \\\\n interview with peter martin \\\\n in recent years , the western world has seen a shift in the way chinese diplomacy is conducted . in contrast with deng xiaoping ’s strategy of “ keeping a low profile , ” chinese officials have more openly expressed controversial thoughts , often with negative ramifications for bilateral relations with other countries . during the covid-19 pandemic , this behavior has become known as “ wolf warrior diplomacy . ” joanna nawrot kiewicz spoke with peter martin , author of china ’s civilian army : the making of wolf warrior diplomacy ( 2021 ) , to better understand the origins and impact of china ’s new diplomatic tactics . \\\\n what is wolf warrior diplomacy , and where did the concept originate ? what incentives are driving chinese officials to engage in this kind of diplomacy ? \\\\n wolf warrior diplomacy has become the shorthand expression for a new , assertive brand of chinese diplomacy . in the past , chinese diplomats tended to keep a lower profile and to be quite cautious and moderate in the way that they interacted with the outside world . recently , however , they have become far more strident and assertive — exhibiting behavior that ranges from storming out of an international meeting to shouting at foreign counterparts and even insulting foreign leaders . \\\\n this turn in chinese foreign policy has been slowly building since 2008 – 9 and accelerated after xi jinping came to office in 2012 – 13 . after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic , chinese diplomats felt under attack but also proud of the way that their country has handled the crisis . the new mixture of confidence and increasing insecurity combined to create what we now call wolf warrior diplomacy . \\\\n chinese diplomats believe they have been under great pressure for many years , have been constantly lectured by the united states and others about the rights and wrongs of the communist system , and have been historically looked down upon by the western world . they can still recall the period of “ national humiliation , ” either personally or from the experiences of parents and grandparents who grew up during this time and suffered tremendously at the hands of foreign powers . \\\\n as an example , when wu jianmin was a kid , guards at the french embassy in nanjing punished him for playing outside its grounds by setting dogs on him . years later , he became china ’s ambassador to france . with this experience and mindset , many chinese diplomats see before them an opportunity to stand up for china with a clarity and confidence that had never been available before . many , but not all of them , see wolf warrior diplomacy as much more defensive than aggressive in nature . \\\\n how does the concept of “ wolf warrior diplomacy ” interact with the narrative of china ’s peaceful rise ? do you see them as contradictory or complementary ? \\\\n in my opinion , many people in china ’s foreign policy establishment would say these two concepts are contradictory . the idea of peaceful rise was developed when china ’s economy began to grow very rapidly and its military power was increasing . chinese leaders wanted to reassure the outside world that their intentions were peaceful and that china ’s rise would not mean major disruptions to the international system or pose a systemic threat to the liberal international order . this international reassurance took many forms , from promoting soft power to developing china ’s ability to distribute aid overseas . \\\\n what we have seen under xi jinping is far more focused on the idea that china ’s system is successful , and that the chinese communist party should not have to apologize for the way the country works . when china is not given the respect chinese officials and top diplomats believe it should receive , there will be a backlash . \\\\n how does china ’s wolf warrior diplomacy play out on online platforms ? do we see the same kind of activity by chinese officials on weibo as on twitter ? \\\\n the behavior that attracts the most attention has been on twitter rather than weibo . the use of social media by chinese diplomats is a very new phenomenon . the chinese foreign ministry was slower , even than other parts of the chinese government , to adopt social media , especially twitter . at first , chinese diplomats did not have a large social media following . the first one to gather a large audience was zhao lijian — spokesperson of the ministry of foreign affairs and previously a diplomat posted in pakistan . after his rise on social media , the foreign ministry realized the power these platforms could have to directly engage with both western elite and the western public . \\\\n with the widespread adoption of twitter over the last few years , diplomats who might not otherwise have been noticed gained a voice and could engage with most of their foreign counterparts . therefore , twitter and social media in general have become an integral tool for wolf warrior diplomacy . the majority of chinese diplomats using these platforms are aiming not to influence chinese citizens but rather to capture the attention of either the foreign ministry or leaders in beijing . \\\\n considering the increased presence of chinese diplomats on social media platforms such as twitter , do you think western politicians will need to become equally active on social media to balance the level of influence ? \\\\n in my experience , western politicians are already very active on twitter , so there is not much that they would need to do in terms of balancing out china ’s influence . moreover , chinese diplomats struggle with persuading international audiences because china ’s propaganda apparatus strictly controls the messaging , resulting in content that western viewers do not find compelling . \\\\n from china ’s perspective , western politicians have an advantage because western media institutions are far more trusted globally and have far greater international reach than their equivalents in china . in some ways , the reliance of chinese diplomats on social media channels reflects their frustration that they cannot reach the audiences they want through traditional media . nonetheless , we can expect an intensification of activities in the conventional media sector . \\\\n are all chinese diplomats obligated to practice wolf warrior diplomacy ? \\\\n wolf warrior diplomacy is a tactic . all chinese diplomats are capable of using the tactic when they need to . what has been notable in recent years is that diplomats have strongly embraced wolf warrior diplomacy and made it the dominant way that they interact with the outside world and with foreign audiences . it seems that this kind of behavior is being rewarded by the party center . those who like zhao lijian have indulged in this tactic have often been promoted very rapidly . \\\\n i think that there are quite a few chinese diplomats who have serious misgivings about the way that china is communicating and the damage that wolf warrior diplomacy seems to be doing to beijing ’s reputation abroad . the problem for those who doubt the tactic is xi jinping . judging by his speeches , as well as his actions , xi will continue rewarding people who conduct diplomacy in a more assertive manner . those who have misgivings need to keep their thoughts to themselves for now , or they will face political repercussions . \\\\n you argue in your book that hostile diplomacy has been a long - standing tactic used by the people ’s republic of china from its inception . however , considering the negative reactions to these diplomatic tactics in other countries , is there any indication that the prc will change its strategy ? \\\\n many chinese diplomats are aware that the response to wolf warrior diplomacy has been very negative and actually damaged china ’s interests in a wide range of cases . however , as during previous periods of assertive diplomacy from china , the primary audience is domestic politicians . therefore , the reaction of foreigners and outsiders is not a top motivator for chinese diplomats . \\\\n there have also been times , nonetheless , when china was more diplomatically isolated and the behavior of its diplomats undermined its international reputation . this led to very impressive periods of rethinking and recalibration , and the prc was able to shift gears to charm the outside world , win friends , and gather genuine support . examples of such eras would include the geneva and bandung conferences in the mid-1950s or the aftermath of the tiananmen square massacre in the early 1990 s . \\\\n what surprises many china watchers is that the same brand of rigorous rethinking has been so slow to materialize in recent years . xi jinping indicated in his remarks over the summer to the politburo study session that china needed to work harder to cultivate a lovable and trustworthy image . however , there is not much evidence indicating that the specific tactics involved in wolf warrior diplomacy would be addressed and recalibrated in the short term . \\\\n peter martin is a defense policy and intelligence reporter at bloomberg and the author of china ’s civilian army : the

the wolves : understanding china 's wolf warrior diplomacy \\\\n ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy , which thrived during the covid-19 pandemic , is epitomized by the assertive actions of chinese diplomats , challenging diplomatic norms . its name comes from a patriotic action movie series about the chinese military , wolf warrior , and its practices are a marked departure from former president hu jintao ’s policies of peaceful rise . the peaceful rise policy was defined largely by china ’s aim for common peace and prosperity with the world ; hu stressed that china 's rise should not be perceived as a threat to the world . although viewed positively domestically , it faces criticism internationally . case studies , including covid-19 origin debates , illustrate the complexities of wolf warrior diplomacy . this article explores the dichotomy of its reception , shedding light on its implications for china 's global role and the dynamics of international diplomacy . \\\\n one of the most prominent cases of wolf warrior diplomacy is the controversy over the origins of covid . while us secretary of state mike pompeo alleged that the ' wuhan virus ' leaked from a laboratory in china , chinese state media levied accusations that the virus instead originated in the us . zhao lijian , one of the most outspoken and prominent chinese wolf warrior diplomats , commented on x , suggesting that it might have been the us army who brought the pandemic to wuhan , and he implied that the us owes the public an explanation . zhao has more than 600,000 followers on x and is constantly tweeting , retweeting , and liking seemingly anything that promotes or defends china . on another of china ’s most prominent social media platforms , weibo , zhao ’s remark has been viewed more than 160 million times , alongside screenshots of the original post on x. according to suis heng zhao 's book the dragon roars back , the conspiracy theory temporarily disappeared from official media after the chinese ambassador to washington , cui tiankai , told american media that the job of finding the source of the virus is for scientists . \\\\n this did not dispel speculations made by chinese propagandists , who have further propagated the conspiracy suggesting that covid was manufactured and leaked from a military installation in frederick , maryland . this installation was once the centre of the us biological weapons program and houses biomedical labs conducting research on viruses , including ebola and smallpox . on x , zhao lijian tweeted a song by the nationalistic chinese rap group cd rev , implying that nefarious plots are being orchestrated by the lab in fort detrick . this call by zhao has been echoed by chinese diplomats based in other countries and by chinese state broadcaster cctv , which aired a report titled the dark history behind fort detrick . on weibo , related hashtags have garnered more than 100 million views . \\\\n acts of wolf warrior diplomacy have not been well - received by the international community , as is particularly evident in cases such as the handling of the covid situation , which has sparked hostility and anti - chinese sentiment . according to the new york times , the spread of conspiracy theories has been detrimental to bilateral relations between china and the us . julian b. gewirtz , a scholar at the weatherhead center for international affairs at harvard , argues that these wolf warrior diplomats seem to have adopted the ‘ donald j. trump school of diplomacy ’ , where both sides engage in spreading disinformation and propagandistic claims about the other , ultimately undermining china 's efforts to be perceived positively globally . this issue is not limited to just the rivalry between the us and china ; in another article by the financial times , gideon rachman contends that wolf warrior diplomacy is counterproductive and alienates potential partners of china , pointing to china ’s deteriorating relations with australia and the eu . chinese officials have increasingly accused australia of racism and war crimes , releasing 14 grievances against the country and imposing tariffs . following eu sanctions against xinjiang and beijing 's counter sanctions against european officials and institutions , the european parliament froze the ratification of a major investment agreement between china and the eu . \\\\n at home in china , this has been viewed in a significantly different and positive light , especially among politicians . in suis heng zhao ’s book , he argues that chinese diplomats and political figures generally take pride in being wolf warriors . for instance , chinese ambassador to france lu shaye perceives wolf warrior diplomacy as a reflection of china 's rightful rise in national strength , asserting that china can no longer conceal its capabilities in the face of suppression by the us and the west . viewing its previous approach of peaceful diplomacy as ‘ lamb diplomacy ’ , wolf warrior diplomacy instead showcases china 's capabilities and knowledge . within china , wolf warrior diplomacy is seen as a natural response to western attempts of containment . an editorial in the global times argues that western diplomats face disgrace as they experience china 's wolf warrior diplomacy first - hand . as it declares , ‘ the days when china can be put in a submissive position are long gone ’ . \\\\n with zhao lijian 's reassignment last year and the onset of a post - covid era , china 's sudden surge in aggressiveness seems to have , in part , subsided . while some speculations suggest that china is recognizing the negative repercussions of this controversial rise , indicating a broader shift back towards aligning with china 's earlier tone of upholding peace and prosperity , the article instead suggests that a domestic perspective is of equal significance in understanding such a broader shift in china 's approach to international relations . despite the potential influence of external pressures from the international community on china 's decisions and its downfall of assertiveness , the views of chinese diplomats , alongside factors of nationalism , internal expectations , and pressures , largely influence how china acts . wolf warrior diplomacy ultimately highlights the need to understand diplomacy on two levels , domestic and international , with its causes and implications , to grasp the full picture of its rise and fall . \\\\n image courtesy of us department of state via wikimedia , © 2015 . some rights

\\\\n in recent years , china has adopted a more assertive and confrontational approach to diplomacy , often referred to as “ wolf warrior ” diplomacy . \\\\n named after a popular chinese action movie series , this approach is characterized by a more aggressive tone in international discourse , a willingness to engage in public spats , and a departure from the traditional chinese policy of “ keeping a low profile ” in global affairs . \\\\n in this blog post , we will delve into the concept of ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy , examine its impact on china ’s international relations , and consider the implications for the broader world stage . \\\\n understanding ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy \\\\n ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy represents a significant shift in china ’s approach to international relations . it is marked by the following key characteristics : \\\\n aggressive rhetoric : chinese diplomats , both official and unofficial , have adopted a more confrontational and assertive rhetoric in their public statements . this includes sharp criticisms of other nations , especially those that question or criticize china ’s policies . \\\\n nationalistic tone : ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy often carries a strong nationalist tone , appealing to a domestic audience and portraying china as a global power that will not be bullied by other nations . \\\\n use of social media : chinese diplomats are active on social media platforms , using them to communicate directly with global audiences and to counter what they perceive as biased narratives in western media . \\\\n economic coercion : china has sometimes used its economic leverage to punish countries that take actions it disapproves of , such as trade restrictions or bans on imports . \\\\n impact on china ’s international relations \\\\n the ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy approach has had several notable impacts on china ’s international relations : \\\\n increased tensions : this aggressive diplomacy has contributed to increased tensions with multiple countries , including the united states , australia , india , and many european nations . public spats and disputes have become more common . \\\\n economic consequences : china ’s willingness to use economic leverage for diplomatic purposes has raised concerns among its trading partners . some countries have sought to diversify their trade relationships to reduce dependence on china . \\\\n nationalism and unity : ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy has garnered support among some segments of the chinese population who view it as a source of national pride . it has also contributed to a sense of unity within the country . \\\\n isolation concerns : there is a growing concern that china ’s assertiveness could lead to its isolation on the global stage , as it risks alienating potential allies and partners . \\\\n implications for the global stage \\\\n the impact of ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy extends beyond china ’s immediate bilateral relations . it has broader implications for global politics and diplomacy : \\\\n geopolitical competition : china ’s assertiveness has exacerbated geopolitical competition , particularly with the united states . this competition affects various issues , including trade , technology , and regional conflicts . \\\\n challenges to multilateralism : china ’s confrontational stance challenges the norms of multilateral diplomacy and institutions like the united nations . it has sometimes obstructed international cooperation on global challenges such as climate change and pandemic response . \\\\n bilateral and regional dynamics : the effects of ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy vary from one region to another . for example , it has strained relations in the south china sea and contributed to territorial disputes . \\\\n global perception : china ’s image on the global stage has been influenced by this new diplomacy . while some see it as a strong , assertive nation , others view it with suspicion and concern . \\\\n conclusion \\\\n china ’s ‘ wolf warrior ’ diplomacy represents a notable departure from its past approach to international relations . while it has garnered support domestically and projected an image of strength , it has also strained relations with key partners and raised concerns about china ’s long - term global standing . the path ahead for china will require a careful balancing act between asserting its interests and maintaining constructive international relations . the world watches closely as china navigates this new era of diplomacy , with the hope that dialogue , cooperation , and diplomacy will ultimately prevail over confrontation . \\\\n wolf warrior \\\\n chinas wolf warrior \\\\n international \\\\n diplomacy \\\\n relations\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"How Does China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ Diplomacy Impact Its International Relations?

The term is derived from the Chinese action - film franchise *Wolf Warrior*. It is characterized by the following aspects:\\n- **Aggressive Rhetoric**: Chinese diplomats have adopted a more confrontational and assertive tone in public statements, sharply criticizing other nations that question or criticize China's policies.\\n- **Nationalistic Tone**: It often carries a strong nationalist flavor, appealing to the domestic audience and presenting China as a global power that will not be bullied by others.\\n- **Use of Social Media**: Chinese diplomats are active on social media to directly communicate with global audiences and counter what they see as biased Western media narratives.\\n- **Economic Coercion**: China may use its economic leverage to punish countries whose actions it disapproves of, such as through trade restrictions or import bans.\\n\\nThis diplomatic style represents a departure from China's previous foreign policy of “keeping a low profile”. It emerged in part due to Xi Jinping's efforts to enhance China's “discourse power” in international politics, as well as the perception of anti - China hostility from the West among Chinese government officials. While it has received support from some segments of the Chinese population and projected an image of strength, it has also led to increased tensions with some countries, raised concerns among trading partners, and sparked debates about its long - term impact on China's international standing.\"}","event_id":"62","event_type":2001}
