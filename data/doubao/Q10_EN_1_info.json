The following is a detailed explanation:- **Historical basis**: As early as the 3rd century AD, the people of the Wu Kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period had contact with Taiwan. In the Sui Dynasty, the government sent troops to Taiwan three times. After the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the central government of China began to set up administrative institutions in Penghu and Taiwan to exercise jurisdiction. In 1684, the Qing Dynasty established the Taiwan Prefecture, which was subordinate to Fujian Province; in 1885, Taiwan was upgraded to a provincial administrative region. These historical facts clearly demonstrate that Taiwan has long been under the jurisdiction of China's central government.- **Legal basis**: During World War II, the Cairo Declaration jointly issued by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 1943 clearly stated that the territory stolen by Japan from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, should be returned to China. The Potsdam Proclamation in 1945 reaffirmed this, and Japan also announced its acceptance of the Potsdam Proclamation and unconditional surrender. In 1945, the Chinese government announced the \"resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan\". These international legal documents have confirmed China's sovereignty over Taiwan from a legal perspective. In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the legal rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and immediately expel the representatives of the Taiwan authorities from the United Nations and all its agencies. This resolution completely resolved the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, including that of Taiwan, and completely eliminated any possibility of creating \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\".",
