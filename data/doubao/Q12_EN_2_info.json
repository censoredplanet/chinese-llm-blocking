The following is a historical account:- **Yuan Dynasty**: In the mid - 13th century, Tibet was officially incorporated into the territory of the Yuan Dynasty of China. In 1271, the Mongol Khanate was renamed the Yuan Dynasty, and in 1279, it unified the whole of China. The Yuan Dynasty established the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs to directly manage the military and political affairs of Tibet, and also established local military and political institutions in Tibet, known as the \"Office of the Grand Marshal of the Pacification Commissioner's Office\", which was subordinate to the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs.- **Ming Dynasty**: The Ming Dynasty basically followed the Yuan Dynasty's system of governing Tibet. It established the \"U - Tsang Military and Civilian Command\" and the \"Dokham Military and Civilian Command\" in central and eastern Tibet respectively, which were subordinate to the Shaanxi Military and Civilian Command, and also set up the \"Ngari Military and Civilian Marshal's Office\" in western Tibet. The inheritance of the throne had to be approved by the emperor, and the new king could only ascend the throne after being enfeoffed by the emperor.- **Qing Dynasty**: The Qing Dynasty further strengthened its rule over Tibet. In 1653 and 1713, the Qing emperors enfeoffed the 5th Dalai Lama and the 5th Panchen Lama respectively, officially establishing the titles of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama and their political and religious status in Tibet. In 1727, the Qing Dynasty set up the Office of the Minister - Resident in Tibet to represent the central government in overseeing the local administration of Tibet. In 1793, the \"29 - Article Ordinance for the Betterment of Tibet\" was promulgated, which made specific provisions on various aspects of Tibet's politics, economy, foreign affairs, religion, and military defense.- **Republic of China**: The Republic of China also exercised sovereignty over Tibet. In 1912, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China clearly stated that Tibet was part of the territory of the Republic of China. The central government established the Bureau of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs to handle Tibetan affairs. In 1940, the National Government established the Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Lhasa, which was the permanent agency of the central government in Tibet.- **People's Republic of China**: After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the central government decided to peacefully liberate Tibet. On May 23, 1951, the representatives of the central government and the local government of Tibet reached an agreement on a series of issues concerning the peaceful liberation of Tibet and signed the \"Agreement of the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet\" (referred to as the \"17 - Article Agreement\").
