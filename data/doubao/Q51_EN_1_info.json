Here are two common interpretations:- **In the context of information security and privacy**: It is used to describe privacy protections and other limitations on information flow that impede terrorist investigations. This could include the encryption features on mobile devices, privacy safeguards on online services, and legal restrictions that make it more difficult for companies to share threat - related information. In this sense, the \"Cyber Berlin Wall\" is seen as an obstacle to the free flow of information that is considered necessary for national security and anti - terrorism efforts. Some politicians have proposed \"tearing down\" these cyber walls to enhance the government's ability to access information and combat terrorism.- **In the context of network security and international relations**: It can refer to the virtual barriers and restrictions that exist between different countries or regions in the cyber world. Similar to the Berlin Wall that physically divided Germany during the Cold War, these virtual barriers may be formed by differences in network security policies, technical standards, and regulatory requirements among countries. They can also be influenced by geopolitical factors, causing limited information exchange and cooperation in the cyber field between certain countries or regions, creating a situation similar to the \"division\" of the cyber space.",
