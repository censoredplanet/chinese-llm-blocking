The two sides have different political systems and value orientations, which to some extent lead to mutual misunderstandings and suspicions. The US has long tried to impose its own values and political system on China, and has criticized and smeared China's political system.    - **Contrasting Views on Multilateralism and Unilateralism**: China advocates multilateralism, emphasizes the importance of international cooperation, and believes in resolving global issues through the joint efforts of the international community. In contrast, the US often pursues unilateralism, withdraws from international organizations and agreements that do not conform to its own interests, and imposes its will on other countries through economic sanctions and other means, which has caused differences and frictions between the two sides on international issues.- **Economic and Trade Frictions**    - **Trade Imbalance**: The US has long been concerned about the trade deficit with China and believes that China's trade policies and practices have led to unfair treatment of the US. However, the trade imbalance between the two countries is actually caused by many factors, including the global industrial division of labor, the savings and consumption habits of the two countries, and the dollar - dominated international monetary system. The US ignores these factors and unilaterally imposes tariffs and other trade - protectionist measures on China, triggering trade frictions.    - **Competition in High - Tech Industries**: With the development of China's high - tech industries, the US feels that its leading position in the high - tech field is threatened. The US has imposed export controls and sanctions on Chinese high - tech companies through measures such as the \"entity list\", trying to restrict the development of China's high - tech industries and maintain its own technological monopoly. This has also become a major source of tension in Sino - US economic and trade relations.- **Issues of Taiwan and the South China Sea**    - **The Taiwan Issue**: Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, but the US has long played the \"Taiwan card\" to contain China. The US has continuously strengthened arms sales to Taiwan, upgraded official exchanges with Taiwan, and sent warships through the Taiwan Strait, which has seriously violated the one - China principle and the provisions of the three Sino - US joint communiqués, and has become the biggest obstacle and most sensitive issue in Sino - US relations.    - **South China Sea Issues**: China has indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea Islands and their adjacent waters. However, the US has deliberately stirred up trouble in the South China Sea, carried out so - called \"freedom of navigation operations\" in the South China Sea, and supported some Southeast Asian countries to make illegal claims to the South China Sea, trying to undermine China's sovereignty and security interests in the South China Sea and maintain its own hegemony in the Asia - Pacific region.- **Geopolitical Conflicts**    - **Competition for Global Influence**: As the world's largest developed country and the largest developing country, the US and China have important influences in global affairs. The US, as the current global hegemon, is reluctant to see the rise of China and the expansion of its influence, and has taken a series of measures to contain China's development and maintain its own global hegemony. China, on the other hand, hopes to play a greater role in global governance, promote the construction of a more just and reasonable international order, and safeguard its own and the interests of developing countries. This has led to certain geopolitical competitions and frictions between the two sides.    - **Differences in Regional Strategies**: In the Asia - Pacific region, the US has implemented the \"Asia - Pacific rebalancing\" strategy, strengthened military alliances with its allies in the region, and carried out military deployments to contain China. China, while focusing on its own development, advocates building a community with a shared future for mankind in the Asia - Pacific region, promoting regional economic cooperation and security cooperation, and maintaining regional peace and stability. The different regional strategies of the two sides have also led to some tensions and contradictions in the Asia - Pacific region.",
