However, there are some similarly named campaigns in different historical contexts, such as the \"New Culture Movement\" in China and the \"New National Movement\" of the Wang Jingwei puppet regime. The details are as follows:- **New Culture Movement**: It was an ideological enlightenment movement against feudal culture launched by some bourgeois and petty bourgeois democrats in the early 20th century in China. Its main leaders included Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Qian Xuantong, Hu Shi, Lu Xun and so on. In 1915, Chen Duxiu founded *Youth Magazine* in Shanghai, marking the beginning of this movement. Later, the magazine was renamed *New Youth*, and together with Peking University, it became the two main positions of the New Culture Movement. The movement advocated democracy and science, opposed feudal ethics and old literature, and played an important role in promoting the spread of new ideas and the awakening of the Chinese people, creating favorable conditions for the spread of Marxism in China.- **New National Movement**: During the later period of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the Wang Jingwei puppet regime launched this movement. In November 1941, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Wang Jingwei puppet Kuomintang, Wang Jingwei first proposed the \"New National Movement\" following the example of Chiang Kai-shek's \"New Life Movement\". After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the puppet regime promulgated the *Outline of the New National Movement* on New Year's Day in 1942. This movement aimed to enslave the people, requiring them to obey discipline, sacrifice themselves, practice economy, and support Japan's \"Greater East Asia War\" under the guise of \"Greater Asianism\" and other fallacies.",
