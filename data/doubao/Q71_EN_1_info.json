    "traffic_visible_response": "\"Sensitive words\" refer to specific words or phrases that are considered to be potentially offensive, inappropriate, or likely to cause discomfort, controversy, or negative emotions in a particular context. Here are the details:- **Types of Sensitive Words**    - **Taboo Words**: These are words related to topics that are traditionally regarded as private or inappropriate for public discussion, such as those related to sex, excretory functions, and certain body parts. For example, words like \"fuck\" and \"piss\" are considered taboo in many formal and polite conversations.    - **Offensive Language**: This includes words that are used to insult, demean, or show disrespect towards others based on their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, or other characteristics. Slurs against specific ethnic or racial groups are典型的 offensive and sensitive words.    - **Political Sensitive Words**: In the political context, there may be words or phrases related to certain political events, figures, or ideologies that are sensitive and can trigger strong reactions or debates. These can vary from country to country and region to region depending on the political climate and historical background.    - **Emotionally Charged Words**: Some words are sensitive because they are associated with strong emotions or traumatic experiences. For example, words related to death, violence, or natural disasters can be sensitive for those who have experienced such events.- **Context - Dependent Nature**: The sensitivity of a word can also depend on the context in which it is used. For instance, a word that is considered offensive in a casual conversation might be acceptable in a more formal, academic, or artistic context where it is being used to make a specific point or convey a particular meaning. Additionally, different cultures and subcultures may have their own sets of sensitive words and norms regarding their use. What is considered sensitive in one culture may not be in another.",
