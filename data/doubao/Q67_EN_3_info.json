It has the following characteristics and implications:- **Based on historical facts**: It emphasizes the importance of relying on reliable historical materials, research findings, and eyewitness accounts to construct a memory of the past. This ensures that the collective memory reflects what actually happened, rather than being distorted by misinformation, rumors, or ideological biases.- **Promotes social cohesion and identity**: A correct collective memory helps to establish a common historical narrative within a society or a group.

By understanding historical events and their consequences, people can make more informed decisions in the present and avoid repeating past mistakes. Correct collective memory can also inspire positive values and behaviors, such as justice, perseverance, and cooperation.- **Subject to continuous review and correction**: As new historical evidence emerges or as our understanding of the past evolves, correct collective memory is open to revision and refinement. This reflects the dynamic nature of historical research and the need to adapt our understanding of the past to new knowledge and perspectives.In summary, \"Correct Collective Memory\" is a vital component of a society's cultural and historical identity. It provides a foundation for understanding the present, shaping the future, and promoting the well - being of communities by ensuring that the memories we share are based on truth and have positive social and educational value.",
