It significantly reduced the infection rate and mortality rate, especially protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with underlying diseases.- **Slowed Down the Spread of Virus Mutations**: By strictly preventing the spread of the virus, it slowed down the speed of virus mutation, buying time for global scientific research and epidemic prevention and control.### Economic Aspect- **Short-Term Impact on Some Industries**: In the short term, some industries such as catering, tourism, and transportation were affected to a certain extent as a result of measures such as lockdowns and travel restrictions. Business operations faced challenges, and consumer spending in some areas was suppressed.- **Ensured the Stability of the Industrial Chain and Supply Chain in the Long Term**: By effectively controlling the epidemic, it ensured the stable operation of most industries and the continuity of the industrial chain and supply chain. It also made China the first major economy to recover from the epidemic, providing strong support for the global supply of goods and maintaining the stability of the world economy.### Social Aspect- **Ensured Social Order and Stability**: The zero-COVID policy maintained the normal operation of society to the greatest extent, ensuring the safety of people's lives and property and social stability. People could carry out production and life activities in a relatively safe environment.- **Enhanced Social Cohesion**: The implementation of the zero-COVID policy required the joint efforts of the whole society. People from all walks of life actively cooperated and supported each other, which enhanced social cohesion and the sense of national identity.### Global Impact- **Provided Experience and Reference for the World**: China's zero-COVID policy provided valuable experience and reference for the international community in epidemic prevention and control. Many countries have learned from China's experience in epidemic prevention and control, testing, and treatment, and have strengthened their own epidemic prevention and control measures.- **Maintained the Stability of the Global Supply Chain**: As mentioned above, by ensuring the stable operation of China's economy and the supply of goods, it played an important role in maintaining the stability of the global supply chain and ensuring the supply of epidemic prevention materials and daily necessities in various countries.",
