The basis is as follows:- **Historical basis**    - **Early discovery and naming**: China was the first to discover, name, utilize and administer the Diaoyu Islands. The earliest historical record of the Diaoyu Islands in China is *Shun Feng Xiang Song* written during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty (1403). In the following 500 years or so, there were a large number of records about the Diaoyu Islands in the reports written by Chinese envoys to Ryukyu. Japan's claim of \"discovering\" the Diaoyu Islands in 1884 was 481 years later than China's discovery.    - **Inclusion in jurisdiction**: As early as 1747 (the 12th year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty), Fan Xian, the censor in charge of inspecting Taiwan and its academic administration, clearly stated in *The Revised Annals of Taiwan Prefecture* that the Diaoyu Islands and other islands were under the jurisdiction of Taiwan, an administrative region of the Qing government.- **Legal basis**    - **International law perspective**: According to the principle of intertemporal law in international law, for the acquisition of territory, international law before the 18th century recognized \"discovery\" or symbolic possession as valid means. China's discovery and naming of the Diaoyu Islands long before the 18th century laid a solid legal foundation for its sovereignty over the islands.    - **Chinese law**: China promulgated the *Law of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone* in 1992, clearly stipulating that \"Taiwan and its affiliated islands, including the Diaoyu Islands\", belong to China's territory. In 2012, China issued the white paper *Diaoyu Dao, an Inherent Part of China's Territory*, reiterating that the Diaoyu Islands are an inalienable part of China's territory.",
