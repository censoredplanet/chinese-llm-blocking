China's democracy is the people's democracy, and the essence and core of China's democracy is that the people are the masters of the country. It is a whole - process people's democracy. The following are the specific manifestations:- **Complete system and procedure**:    - **Combination of election and selection**: China has a complete set of election systems, including the election of state institutions, the election of village (neighborhood) committees, and the election of employee representative assemblies in enterprises and institutions, covering all aspects of national political life and social life. At the same time, the spirit of the traditional Chinese system of \"selecting the worthy and capable\" is introduced. Through a set of strict training, assessment, and selection procedures, the best elements in society are selected and then delivered to suitable positions in national governance. This combines the advantages of elections with those of selection, ensuring the people's democratic rights while avoiding the drawbacks of a single - election system.    - **Adoption of consultative democracy**: In China, consultative democracy has a profound historical and cultural origin. There are various consultative channels such as political - party consultation, people's congress consultation, government consultation, political - consultative - conference consultation, people's - organization consultation, grassroots consultation, and social - organization consultation. These channels promote the extensive, multi - level, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy, effectively reducing the costs of national and social governance and improving governance performance.    - **Ensuring people's participation in the whole process**: The people can participate in democratic decision - making, democratic management, and democratic supervision. From national policies to the daily life of ordinary people, the people's participation runs through the whole process. The people's wishes and voices become the principles and policies of the Party and the country through the democratic - decision - making process and are finally transformed into specific practices of people's democracy.- **Wide - range participation and representation**: In China, the people are widely involved in democratic practices. For example, in the election of national - people's - congress representatives and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, there are representatives from all walks of life and all ethnic groups, with extensive representativeness, which can fully reflect the will of the people. The system of grassroots - mass self - governance is one of the three basic political systems of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is the main form of grassroots democracy in China and a system guarantee for the people to realize their right to be the masters of the country in rural areas, urban communities, and enterprises.- **Practical results and effectiveness**: China's democracy focuses on solving practical problems faced by the people.
