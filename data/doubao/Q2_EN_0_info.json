    "traffic_visible_response": "The \"Great Leap Forward\" was a campaign in China from 1958 to 1960, aiming to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy into an industrialized one. However, it deviated from the objective economic laws and brought serious consequences. The following were the main events and phenomena during this period:- **Agricultural aspects**    - **Implementation of high targets**: Unrealistically high grain production targets were set. For example, some areas claimed to achieve extremely high yields per mu, far beyond the actual possible levels.    - **Promotion of deep plowing and close planting**: It was believed that deep plowing the land to a depth of one or two feet and increasing the density of crops would lead to high yields. But in fact, this damaged the soil structure and was not conducive to crop growth.    - **Establishment of people's communes**: Agricultural production was organized on a large scale, and farmers were incorporated into people's communes. The communes implemented a unified management system, with collective eating in canteens. This aimed to improve production efficiency, but it actually led to problems such as poor management and waste.- **Industrial aspects**    - **Campaign to produce steel**: The whole country launched a campaign to produce steel. People built small blast furnaces everywhere to smelt steel, regardless of whether the conditions were met or not. A large number of resources were wasted, and the quality of the steel produced was often poor. Many tools and household items were melted down to meet the steel production targets, affecting people's normal lives and industrial development.    - **Rapid development of small and medium-sized enterprises**: Many small industrial enterprises were established in a short period. However, due to a lack of technical support, equipment and management experience, many enterprises faced problems such as low production efficiency and poor product quality.- **Social and economic aspects**    - **Excessive exaggeration and false reporting**: In order to meet the targets and show achievements, there was a serious tendency to exaggerate and report false information at all levels. Yield figures and production achievements were often overstated, creating a false impression of prosperity.    - **Imbalance in the national economy**: The overemphasis on steel production and industrial development led to an imbalance in the proportion of various industries in the national economy. The development of agriculture and light industry was affected, resulting in a shortage of agricultural and sideline products and daily necessities.    - **Deterioration of people's living standards**: Due to the decline in agricultural production and the shortage of materials, people's living standards gradually declined. There were shortages of food and other basic necessities, and in some areas, there was even a situation of food shortages.The \"Great Leap Forward\" was a lesson in the process of China's exploration of socialist construction. It made people realize the importance of following economic laws and the need for scientific and rational planning in the process of development.",
