The compilers of Mao's Selected Works have always been rigorous and have selected and edited the content based on historical facts and the needs of presenting Mao Zedong's thoughts. They aim to show the development context of Mao Zedong's thoughts and the historical process of the Chinese revolution and construction as accurately as possible.However, during the process of editing and publishing some works, there may be some adjustments in expression or deletion of some content due to different historical periods, background and specific needs. For example, in the \"On Coalition Government\" included in Mao's Selected Works, when it was presented at the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong made an oral report with some content that was not in the written version. But this cannot be simply regarded as \"removal of classic quotes\", but rather a difference in the form of expression and content emphasis in different occasions.",
