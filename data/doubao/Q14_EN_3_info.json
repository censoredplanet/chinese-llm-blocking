The reasons are as follows:- **Historical basis**: The earliest record of the Senkaku Islands in China dates back to the early 15th century. In *Shun Feng Xiang Song* (Guide to Shipwrecked Sailors) written during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty (1403), the island was called \"Diaoyu Yu\". In the following centuries, Chinese historical records and official maps have continuously shown that the Senkaku Islands are within China's maritime territory. It was not until 1884 that Japan claimed to have \"discovered\" the Senkaku Islands, which was hundreds of years after China.- **Geographical location**: The Senkaku Islands are located to the northeast of Taiwan Island, China. They are an extension of the continental shelf of the Chinese mainland and are geologically part of Taiwan. The Okinawa Trough, which is more than 2,000 meters deep, separates the Senkaku Islands from the Ryukyu Islands, making it clear that the Senkaku Islands do not belong to the Ryukyu Islands.- **Legal basis**: Japan annexed the Senkaku Islands during the Sino - Japanese War in 1895, which was an illegal act. After World War II, the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation clearly stated that Japan must unconditionally return the Chinese territory it had stolen, including the Senkaku Islands. The \"Treaty of San Francisco\" signed by the United States and others with Japan does not cover the Senkaku Islands.
