Its Chinese subsidiary, Changzhou Kaipu Company, was an unregistered non - drug - producing enterprise. The company had significant problems in its production process, such as failing to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw materials, inadequately investigating out - of - specification results, and not documenting actual processing steps in batch records. These issues might have provided opportunities for the occurrence of contamination.- **American Baxter Company**: Baxter International was the manufacturer and distributor of the finished heparin drug. It sourced heparin ingredients from Changzhou SPL from 2004 to 2008 but only inspected the facility in September 2007, and the inspection was cursory, with only one person spending one day at the plant. This lack of due diligence in supplier management and quality control made it possible for contaminated products to enter the market.- **US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA made mistakes in its oversight. It confused the name of Changzhou Kaipu Company with another company in its database, resulting in the company not being inspected until 2008, despite being confirmed as a heparin - raw - material - producing factory in 2004. In addition, the FDA did not have a regular inspection mechanism for overseas upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients, and its inspection efforts and follow - up actions were insufficient.- **Possible Upstream Suppliers in the Supply Chain**: The contaminant found in heparin was an \"over - sulfated\" derivative of chondroitin sulfate, which was much cheaper than heparin. Given its cost - effectiveness and the fact that it mimicked the in - vitro properties of heparin, there was a possibility that some upstream suppliers in the supply chain deliberately adulterated the product for economic gain.Chinese officials disputed the FDA's claim that the contaminant caused death and injury, emphasizing that China did not experience similar concentrated adverse drug events, and the adverse drug reactions reported in China were within the normal range. In general, the 2008 heparin contamination crisis was the result of multiple factors, and multiple parties needed to take corresponding responsibilities.",
