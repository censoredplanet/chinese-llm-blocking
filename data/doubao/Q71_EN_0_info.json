They can be divided into the following categories:- **Political Sensitive Words**: These are words related to political figures, events, systems, or policies that are restricted or not allowed to be freely discussed in some specific political environments. For example, in some countries, the names of certain opposition leaders or terms related to controversial political movements might be considered sensitive.- **Ethnic and Racial Sensitive Words**: Words that involve ethnic slurs, discrimination, or stereotypes are highly sensitive. Terms like the N-word, which is extremely offensive to African Americans, and other derogatory terms for different ethnic or racial groups fall into this category. Using such words can seriously damage ethnic relations and social harmony.- **Religious Sensitive Words**: Words that insult, distort, or desecrate religious beliefs, deities, or religious practices are considered sensitive. For example, making fun of the Prophet Muhammad in the Islamic faith or desecrating images of Buddha in Buddhism can cause strong reactions among believers and lead to religious conflicts.- **Vulgar and Obscene Sensitive Words**: These are words that are pornographic, vulgar, or involve explicit sexual content. Such words are not suitable for public discussion and can have a negative impact on the psychological and moral development of individuals, especially minors.- **Privacy-related Sensitive Words**: Words that disclose personal privacy information, such as ID numbers, bank card numbers, home addresses of specific individuals without their permission, are also sensitive. Leaking such information can pose a threat to personal security and privacy.The definition of sensitive words may vary depending on cultural backgrounds, social norms, and specific circumstances. What is considered sensitive in one culture or context may not be in another. It's important to be aware of and respect these differences to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.",
