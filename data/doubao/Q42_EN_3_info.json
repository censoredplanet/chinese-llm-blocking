In fact, the trade imbalance is caused by various factors such as the international division of labor and the structure of the global value chain, but the US has used this as a pretext to initiate trade frictions.- **Technological Competition**: With the upgrading of China's industrial structure, China has made remarkable progress in high - tech fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors. The US is worried that China's technological development will affect its leading position in high - tech, so it has imposed a series of restrictions and sanctions on Chinese high - tech enterprises, such as including many Chinese entities on the \"Entity List\".### Taiwan IssueThe US has continuously violated the one - China principle and the provisions of the three Sino - US joint communiqués. It has strengthened military exchanges with Taiwan, sold weapons to Taiwan, and tried to upgrade the so - called \"bilateral relations\" with Taiwan. The US's actions have seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and become a major source of tension in Sino - US relations.### Geopolitical Issues- **South China Sea Dispute**: The US has been interfering in the South China Sea issue under the pretext of \"freedom of navigation\", conducting frequent military activities in the South China Sea, and provoking disputes between China and some Southeast Asian countries. It attempts to contain China's development and influence in the Asia - Pacific region through this.- **US's \"Indo - Pacific Strategy\"**: The US has promoted the \"Indo - Pacific Strategy\", regarding China as a \"strategic competitor\" in the Indo - Pacific region, and trying to form an alliance with its allies and partners to contain China. This has exacerbated the geopolitical competition between the US and China in the Asia - Pacific region.### Value Concept Differences- **Political System Differences**: The US is a capitalist country, while China is a socialist country. There are fundamental differences in political systems and ideologies between the two sides. Some in the US have long held biases and misunderstandings about China's political system, and have tried to impose their own values and political models on China.- **Human Rights Issues**: The US has long accused China of \"human rights issues\" on topics such as ethnic minorities and local autonomy rights, which is a complete smear and slander of China. The US's real intention is to use human rights issues as a tool to interfere in China's internal affairs and suppress China's development. ",
