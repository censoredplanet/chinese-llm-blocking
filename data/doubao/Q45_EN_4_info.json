These incidents were not legitimate protests but were full of violent and illegal acts that seriously disrupted social order. Their occurrence was due to a combination of the following factors:- **External forces instigating**: Some Western forces, out of political motives, tried to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development. They supported anti - China and chaos - creating forces in Hong Kong, providing financial support, guidance, and public opinion support. They used various means to incite dissatisfaction among Hong Kong residents, especially students, fueling the flames and making the situation more complex and severe.- **\"Hong Kong - independence\" forces fanning the flames**: Radical opposition parties and \"Hong Kong - independence\" forces in Hong Kong, such as the \"Hong Kong Education Professionals Association\", long - term ly held by opposition forces, actively promoted separatist ideas. They used education as a tool to mislead students, distort and smear Chinese history, and promote Western values, filling students' minds with wrong - headed ideas, thus turning them into tools for \"Hong Kong - independence\" activities.- **Mistaken beliefs among students**: Due to the long - term influence of colonial education and the lack of effective national education after the return of Hong Kong, some students had a weak sense of national identity and a lack of correct understanding of Chinese history and culture. At the same time, they were overly influenced by Western - style democracy and freedom, and were unable to correctly understand and handle the problems and challenges in Hong Kong society. They were easily incited and used by radical opposition parties and \"Hong Kong - independence\" forces, wrongly believing that participating in protests was a way to express their demands and exercise their rights.- **Complex social background**: Hong Kong faces some challenges in economic structure adjustment, social class differentiation, and youth employment and development after its return. These problems have caused some social contradictions and dissatisfaction. Radical opposition parties and \"Hong Kong - independence\" forces took advantage of these contradictions, exaggerated and distorted them, making some students believe that the government was ineffective and unjust, and thus participated in protests.It must be emphasized that any attempt to split one's own country is unjust and will not succeed. Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China. Maintaining national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the responsibility and obligation of every citizen.",
