The report showed that over 80% of female journalists had experienced sexual harassment. In October 2017, Luo Xixi, a survivor of sexual harassment and a Ph.D. graduate from Beihang University, reported anonymously to the university that her former Ph.D. advisor, Chen Xiaowu, had been harassing graduate students for years. Luo Xixi sought help from Huang. They formed an alliance called \"Hard Candy\" and exposed Chen Xiaowu's behavior on Weibo on January 1, 2018, which received more than three million views within a day. In response, the university revoked Chen Xiaowu's teaching credentials, and the Ministry of Education revoked his \"Changjiang Scholar\" title. This marked the start of the #MeToo movement in China.
