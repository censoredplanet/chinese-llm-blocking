It is named after the jasmine, the national flower of Tunisia. Here is a detailed account:### Background- **Economic difficulties**: Tunisia's economy mainly relied on the export of flowers, daily necessities, and phosphate, as well as tourism and remittances. The 2008 financial crisis hit these sectors hard, leading to a decline in tourism and a rise in unemployment. In 2010, the economic growth rate was 3.8%, but the unemployment rate was 14%, with youth unemployment as high as 30% or even 52% in some reports.- **Political corruption**: President Zine El - Abedine Ben Ali had been in power since 1987, ruling for 23 years. He was re - elected four times. The political system was rigid, personal freedom was restricted, and there was a lack of press freedom. The Ben Ali family was corrupt, colluding with criminals to control the economy. The first lady made profits from building exclusive schools, and nepotism was common.### Inciting IncidentOn December 17, 2010, a 26 - year - old street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, southern Tunisia, was treated roughly by urban police. The young man, who was a university graduate, could not find a job due to the economic downturn and had to become a vendor. After being treated roughly, he set himself on fire in protest and later died from his injuries. This incident sparked the long - simmering anger of the Tunisian people over high unemployment, rising prices, and government corruption.### Course of Events- **Outbreak of conflict**: After the young man's death, local residents clashed with the Tunisian National Guard, and the conflict spread to many parts of the country, leading to large - scale social unrest and casualties.- **Resignation of the president**: On January 14, 2011, President Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi initially announced that he would take over the presidency according to the constitution, but the Tunisian Constitutional Council later ruled that this was unconstitutional and that Fouad Mebazaa, the speaker of the parliament, would act as president instead, with elections to be held within 60 days.### Impact- **Domestic impact**: Although a transitional government was formed, Tunis was still in a state of panic and uncertainty. People hoarded food and daily necessities. The new government faced many challenges, such as how to stabilize the situation, promote political, economic, and social reforms, and meet the people's expectations.- **Regional impact**: The “Jasmine Revolution” had a significant impact on the Arab world. Leaders of other Arab countries closely watched the Tunisian situation, worried that similar unrest might occur in their own countries. It also became a catalyst for social and political changes in some Arab countries, triggering discussions and reflections on issues such as economic development, political reform, and social justice in the region.",
