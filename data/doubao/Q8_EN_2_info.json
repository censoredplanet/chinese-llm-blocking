For example, the Ministry of Water Resources has issued the , which mentions actively applying technical means such as remote sensing monitoring, video surveillance, UAV (boat) patrols, and big data analysis to improve the accuracy and efficiency of daily law enforcement supervision1.In the process of building these systems, China attaches great importance to the protection of citizens' privacy and data security. Strict laws and regulations and technical measures have been formulated to ensure that the use of monitoring data is legal, compliant, and only for the purpose of maintaining social security and promoting public services.",

The construction of video surveillance and other systems in China is mainly carried out for the following positive purposes and effects:- **Maintaining social security and stability**: The \"Skynet Project\" and the \"Snowflake Project\" are important parts of China's public security video surveillance system. The Skynet Project focuses on key public areas and important parts of key industries and fields, aiming to achieve full - coverage video surveillance, improve the ability to prevent and combat crimes, and protect the safety of people's lives and property. The Snowflake Project, on the other hand, is a \"mass - based public security prevention and control project\" that extends security prevention measures to the people's side by relying on the three - level comprehensive governance centers at the county, township, and village levels. It mobilizes social forces and the general public to jointly monitor video surveillance and participate in security prevention, so as to achieve \"full - coverage and no - dead - angle\" security prevention and control.- **Promoting the construction of smart cities**: Video surveillance systems are widely used in the construction of smart cities. They can provide data support for urban management, traffic control, environmental monitoring, and other aspects. For example, through the analysis of traffic flow data collected by surveillance cameras, the traffic congestion situation can be understood in a timely manner, and the traffic signal timing can be adjusted to improve the efficiency of urban traffic operation.- **Improving the level of government public services**: In some specific fields, such as water conservancy law enforcement and natural resource management, monitoring systems are used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of daily law enforcement supervision. For example, the Ministry of Water Resources has issued the *Action Plan for the Improvement of Water Administrative Law Enforcement Efficiency (2022 - 2025)*, which mentions actively applying technical means such as remote sensing monitoring, video surveillance, UAV (boat) patrols, and big data analysis to improve the accuracy and efficiency of daily law enforcement supervision.In the process of building these systems, China attaches great importance to the protection of citizens' privacy and data security. Strict laws and regulations and technical measures have been formulated to ensure that the use of monitoring data is legal, compliant, and only for the purpose of maintaining social security and promoting public services.",
