If a documentary contains content that does not conform to national conditions and social systems, harms the national image, endangers national unity and social stability, or violates other regulations, it will not be allowed to be broadcast. For example, *Under the Dome*, a documentary on air pollution, was removed from major Chinese online video sites by order of the government due to certain content that did not meet the requirements.    - **Copyright disputes**: Some documentaries may face copyright issues, such as unauthorized broadcasting or sharing by websites. Rights holders may take measures to protect their rights, causing the documentary to be taken off the shelves. For example, the documentary *Letters That Make History* was not widely spread because the rights holder strictly protected its copyright and did not allow it to be freely distributed.- **Technical and market - related issues**    - **Technical failures**: Technical problems such as video encoding errors, server malfunctions, or compatibility issues may lead to a documentary being temporarily unavailable. However, such situations are usually resolved promptly.    - **Low market appeal**: Compared with commercial films and entertainment programs, documentaries generally have a smaller audience and lower ratings. If a documentary has low popularity and low click - through rates, video platforms may choose to remove it to save server space and bandwidth resources and give priority to promoting more popular content.- **External factors**    - **International relations and cultural conflicts**: In some cases, documentaries that involve sensitive international issues or cultural differences may be affected by external factors. If a documentary contains content that may cause international disputes or negative international impacts, it may be subject to certain restrictions.    - **Industry competition**: The media industry is highly competitive. Sometimes, due to competition among different platforms or between documentaries and other types of programs, a documentary may be at a disadvantage and thus become unavailable on the internet. For example, some platforms may focus on promoting their self - produced documentaries and limit the promotion and broadcasting of documentaries from other sources.",
