During the \"Cultural Revolution,\" they engaged in a series of harmful activities, which are detailed as follows:1. **Fomenting the \"Cultural Revolution\"**: In 1965, at the instigation of Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan wrote *Comment on the New Historical Play *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, which became the fuse for triggering the \"Cultural Revolution\". In the early stage of the \"Cultural Revolution\", Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan were the main members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, playing a crucial role in launching the \"Cultural Revolution\" and overthrowing the so-called \"Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping Bourgeois Headquarters\".2. **Conspiring to Usurp Party and State Power**: After the downfall of the Lin Biao counter-revolutionary clique in 1971, Wang Hongwen formed an alliance with Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. They actively sought to usurp the highest leadership of the Party and the country. They colluded with each other, formed cliques, and built a national network of cronies. After Mao Zedong's death, they took advantage of the situation and tried to take control by forging Mao's last words, such as \"Act according to the established principles\".3. **Creating Political Turmoil**: They launched the \"Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius\" campaign in January 1974, aiming their attacks at Zhou Enlai. They also used their control over the media to promote extreme leftist ideology, creating ideological confusion and political unrest. They made a series of false accusations against a large number of veteran revolutionary comrades, cadres, and intellectuals, describing them as \"capitalist roaders\" and \"counter-revolutionaries\", and persecuting them on a large scale, which seriously disrupted the Party's organizational system and social order.4. **Sabotaging the Economy**: Their actions led to the paralysis of production and management in many enterprises and institutions, seriously disrupting the normal economic order. They opposed any form of economic adjustment and reform, believing them to be \"capitalist restoration,\" which greatly damaged the national economy and caused a significant decline in people's living standards.5. **Attempting Armed Rebellion**: After Mao Zedong's death, Zhang Chunqiao secretly instructed his henchmen in Shanghai to prepare for war, indicating that Shanghai was facing a \"major test\". The \"Gang of Four\" readied themselves for an armed rebellion in an attempt to seize power by force.",
