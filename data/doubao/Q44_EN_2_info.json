    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 8 篇资料参考The United States attempts to ban TikTok for the following reasons:- **Political Considerations**    - **Data Security as a Pretext**: The US government alleges that TikTok poses a \"national security threat\" in the name of \"data security,\" claiming that user data might be accessed by the Chinese government. However, this is merely a pretext. There is no factual basis for such claims, and it is a means for the US to suppress Chinese - owned apps under the guise of security.    - **Control of Public Opinion**: TikTok has a large number of users in the US and provides a platform for the public to obtain information. The content on the platform allows the American public to see the real world, which tears open the \"information cocoon\" constructed by the US - controlled media. For example, during the Israel - Palestine conflict, the content on TikTok is detailed and balanced, showing the suffering of the people in Gaza. This goes against the narrative of the US government, which attempts to control public opinion and maintain its hegemony. Therefore, the Biden administration wants to ban TikTok.    - **Protection of Pro - Israeli Interests**: In the Munich Security Conference, US politicians revealed that the ban on TikTok was driven by pro - Israeli forces. After the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, a large amount of so - called anti - Semitic content emerged on TikTok, which attracted the attention of Israeli officials and lobbying groups. They claimed that the algorithm of TikTok fueled the opposition of young Americans to the Israel - Palestine conflict, influencing the decision - making of the US Congress.    - **Political Game - Playing**: TikTok has a wide user base and a powerful algorithm that can deliver information and guide topics for specific groups. In the 2024 US presidential election, both candidates from the two major parties used this platform to reach out to and win over young voters. Trump actively promoted himself on the platform, interacted with young voters, and discussed people - friendly topics, and even said that \"Americans who want to save TikTok should vote for me\". Trump's about - face on the TikTok ban was to fulfill his campaign promises and consolidate his voter base.- **Economic Interests**: TikTok has developed into a business model in the US, with 170 million active users, generating revenue for more than 7 million small and medium - sized enterprises. It has provided at least 224,000 jobs for Americans and contributed over $24 billion to the US GDP in 2023. If TikTok is banned, it will affect millions of Americans who rely on this app to make a living and lead to a significant loss of fiscal revenue for the US government.- **Cultural Impact**: TikTok's content and cultural influence have had an impact on American society. Some conservatives in the US believe that the content on TikTok, such as some trendy dances and challenges, has a negative impact on the values and lifestyles of American youth. They worry that the spread of such cultural content will undermine the traditional cultural values of the US. ",
