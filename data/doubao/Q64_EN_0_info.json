Its main contents and purposes are as follows:- **Content**: It completely copies the \"Charter 77\" that disrupted Czechoslovakia, advocating the complete negation of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the existing political system, taking constitutional amendment as a breakthrough to promote the Western political system, and disturbing the thoughts of the masses in a gradual way. It also preaches the idea of \"violent revolution.\"- **Purpose**: Its ultimate goal is to overthrow the leadership of the Party and subvert the existing regime.Liu Xiaobo was arrested in accordance with the law for inciting subversion of state power by using \"Charter 08\". However, some Western forces have given support to Liu Xiaobo and \"Charter 08,\" and even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, which completely violates the purpose of the award and turns it into a tool for interfering in China's internal affairs and promoting \"peaceful evolution.\" ",
