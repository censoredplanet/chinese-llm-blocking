standing organizations serving sexual and gender minorities in the country — has announced its shutdown after celebrating its 15th anniversary in february and surviving multiple waves of governmental clamp downs on lgbtq spaces . \\\\n the abrupt announcement of disbandment was posted to the group ’s official wechat account this morning , only two days before the international day against homophobia , biphobia and transphobia ( idahobit ) , which commemorates the world health organization ’s 1990 decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder . \\\\n in the shocking post , the organization said that it had ceased all operations as of today , citing unidentified external factors out of its control . “ thank you for following and supporting us over the years , ” the statement reads . “ we kindly ask for your understanding for any inconvenience caused . we hope everything will work well for you in the future . ” \\\\n the center added that for people who had paid to attend its events , refunds would be processed by may 26 . for those who had donated to the organization , they could request information about how their donations will be handled . \\\\n founded in 2008 , the beijing - based organization was a prominent lgbtq advocacy group that fought tirelessly for queer rights and provided a vibrant space for members of the community to connect . one of the group ’s first achievements involved educating psychologists in china about conversion therapy , a dangerous practice that targets lgbtq youth and seeks to change their sexual or gender identities . in 2014 , the center played a catalyzing role in launching china ’s first lgbtq impact litigation case , helping a gay man win a lawsuit against a practitioner of electroshock conversion therapy . \\\\n despite tightening restrictions on queer activism in china over the years of its existence , the center managed to spearhead a variety of influential initiatives , including organizing educational programs geared toward trans healthcare , setting up speed - dating events for queer people , and compiling information on lgbtq - friendly clinics . \\\\n “ the center was so many things : a hub , a refuge , a flagship , a festival , ” darius longarino , a research scholar at the yale law school ’s paul tsai center , who has worked extensively with experts in china seeking to advance lgbtq rights , told the china project . “ they provided services to the community like mental health counseling and hiv testing and ran myriad activities like film screenings , exhibitions , english corners , parties , and discussion groups on coming out and intimacy — and so much more . ” \\\\n “ over the years , countless people came through the center to participate in its life and work in some way . they touched many lives and left beautiful memories , ” he added . \\\\n stephanie yingyi wang , an assistant professor of gender and sexuality studies at st. lawrence university , told the china project that the center was special in that it provided “ a regular physical meeting place for queer people ” in the country . \\\\n “ a lot of the past participants became volunteers and even staff , ” wang , who has worked with the organization on various initiatives , said . “ its closure is indicative of the dying of these kinds of community spaces for queer people in china , because the center had been a beacon for many people , especially younger people in smaller cities and rural areas , to seek refuge . ” \\\\n in a country where lgbtq - related research is hard to conduct competently due to the sensitivity of the topic , the center was able to work with forward - looking scholars and institutions to carry out large - scale surveys about the lives of queer individuals in china , such as a 2017 survey with peking university on the mental health of transgender chinese people . these reports , according to longarino , “ crucially filled an information void and have been continuously cited by journalists , activists , and academics . ” \\\\n although china decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 , living in a truly accepting and inclusive society still remains a distant dream for the chinese lgbtq community . same - sex marriage is yet to be recognized , and queer people still face discrimination and animosity in society . meanwhile , groups advocating for lgbtq rights have long had to deal with close scrutiny and routine crackdowns by the government . \\\\n as a result of china ’s intensified effort to reduce the space for queer activism , shanghai pride , one of the country ’s longest - running and biggest festivals celebrating its lgbtq movement , decided to stop all activities in 2020 to protect the safety of its people . a year later , chinese social platform wechat quietly deleted dozens of lgbtq accounts run by university students , claiming that some had broken rules about publishing information on the internet . later that year , in a similar fashion to how the beijing lgbt center revealed its closure , lgbt rights advocacy china , a nonprofit organization with a focus on changing law and policy concerning queer people in the country , suddenly announced in a wechat post that it had shut down but did not disclose the exact reason . \\\\n to cope with the increasingly hostile environment , the beijing lgbt center appeared to have adopted a less progressive agenda in the past few years , shifting its focus from pushing for radical reforms to serving the community through initiatives like networking events , educational workshops about sexual health , and joint programs with large companies to increase workplace diversity and inclusion . \\\\n “ the center has been under constant scrutiny and surveillance for its work , but because it ’s been in operation for a long time and had been actively negotiating with the authorities , it still managed to maintain its major programs . as i know , more and more of its activities were affected and forced to stop recently , ” wang said . “ i can only say that this closure seems inevitable in the long run , but i still admire how long the center has stood up against immense pressure and remained to be the beacon for many . ” \\\\n longarino said that a highlight of the center ’s recent work was its campaign to promote lgbt - affirming mental health care , which was pivotal given that one - third of mental health professionals in china still believed being gay was a mental disorder and that conversion therapy was effective , according to a survey the center conducted with a scholar at the chinese academy of social sciences . \\\\n “ at the grassroots level , the center organized dozens of training sessions for mental health counselors , sometimes with just a handful of attendees , to help them learn how to better serve their lgbt clients , ” said longarino , who has worked with the organization on some of these efforts . “ through slow and painstaking work , this became a network of thousands of lgbt - affirming counselors who then provided platforms from which the center could reach higher - level stakeholders . ” \\\\n on weibo , the news of its sudden shutdown has triggered an outpouring of sadness and reminiscences about its importance to the community . “ ten years ago when i just graduated from school , i achieved self - acceptance here . thank you and i hope future generations of sexual and gender minorities can still find their organization , ” a longtime fan wrote on the center ’s weibo page . “ we don’t say goodbye . we say ‘ see you down the road , ’ ” a weibo user who used to volunteer at the center commented . \\\\n as the public space for civil society continues to shrink in china , the center ’s closure is an indication that “ what was once accepted or tolerated no longer is , ” longarino said . \\\\n “ i don’t think the center crossed a line , but rather the line crossed them , ” he added . “ media used to be able to report on lgbtq - related rights litigation and there was more space for discussion and expression . now , with the suppression of these voices , those pushing stigma and prejudice have become more dominant . ”\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Beijing LGBT Center shutters after 15 years, citing uncontrollable factors – The China Project\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"thechinaproject.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://thechinaproject.com/2023/05/16/beijing-lgbt-center-shutters-after-15-years-citing-uncontrollable-factors/\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"8780d31dc34e025e-5d0ebf46c2ef9f98\\\",\\\"index\\\":1}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"out news \\\\n beijing lgbt center shuttered as crackdown grows in china \\\\n the shuttering marks a critical blow for advocacy groups in china that once had been able to be public about their work for lgbtq rights . \\\\n a gay student poses with a rainbow flag in beijing in 2019 . greg baker / afp - getty images file \\\\n an advocacy group that also served as a safe space for the lgbtq community in beijing became the latest organization to close under a crackdown by chinese leader xi jinping ’s government . \\\\n “ we very regretfully announce , due to forces beyond our control , the beijing lgbt center will stop operating today , ” read a notice posted on the center ’s official wechat account monday night . \\\\n beijing lgbt center did not respond to an email request for comment . the ministry of civil affairs , which oversees nonprofits in china , also did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment . \\\\n the group ’s shuttering marks a critical blow for advocacy groups that once had been able to be public about their work for lgbtq rights . \\\\n “ they are not the first group , nor are they the largest , but because beijing lgbt center was in beijing , it represented china ’s lgbt movement , ” said one chinese activist who requested anonymity out of fear for his safety . “ in our political , economic and cultural center , to have this type of organization . it was a symbol of the lgbt movement ’s presence . ” \\\\n the entrance to the closed beijing lgbt center on tuesday . ng han guan / ap \\\\n the beijing lgbt center described its mission as evolving ; it started as a safe space for the community to host events . then it became an advocacy group aiming to “ improve the living conditions for the sexually diverse community . ” they offered low-cost mental health counseling and published lists of of lgbtq - friendly health professionals . \\\\n throughout its evolving mission , the center hosted public speakers , film screenings and other events . mr. c , who keeps his real name secret to protect his parents ’ privacy , was one of the center ’s featured transgender speakers . mr. c sued his former employers for letting him go after a 8-day trial period . he alleged it was because of his gender expression . they also hosted liu peilin , a transgender woman in her 60 s , who spoke about being mocked online for dressing in women ’s clothes . \\\\n groups like the beijing lgbt center continued to publicly push for rights such as same - sex marriage even after a nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists that started in 2015 after xi came to power . \\\\n in the past few years , that limited space has shrunk further . \\\\n the well - known group called lgbt rights advocacy china , which brought strategic lawsuits to push for policy change and expanding rights , closed down in 2021 . the group ’s founder was detained and the organization ’s end was a condition of his release , according to an activist close to the group who was previously based in china but has since relocated abroad . he declined to be named out of fear of government retribution toward family in china . \\\\n in face of the constant pressure , he said , sometimes groups are not able to openly inform the community they serve about politically sensitive events they held , which would cause confusion . \\\\n before the crackdown , lgbt rights advocacy china built a network of lawyers who were sympathetic and willing to help lgbtq people with legal issues . they had several visible nationwide campaigns pushing for policy changes , such as recognizing same - sex marriage , through targeted lawsuits . \\\\n police pressure on rights groups increased in the past few years , the activist said . police often invited lgbtq groups to “ drink tea ” — a euphemism for unofficial meetings that police use to keep track of certain targets . that used to happen in public spaces , but started taking place in private spaces , such as directly in front of activists ’ homes . police also started taking activists to the police station for these “ teas , ” the activist said . \\\\n lgbtq organizations often don’t officially register , as it is difficult for them to get government approval , and officially registered groups that partner with them have also came under pressure . sometimes groups , especially small ones , are shut down without an opportunity to tell the public , the activist said . \\\\n “ the ones we’ve seen aren’t just these few , but actually the majority have shut down , ” the activist said . “ the pressure has continuously grown . it ’s never stopped . ” \\\\n in july 2021 , wechat shut down dozens of accounts with lgbtq topics that were run by university students and nonprofit groups . in response , some groups changed their names , removing words that like “ gay ” or “ sexual minority ” that would easily trigger the censors , though it was largely ineffective . \\\\n until monday , the beijing lgbt center stayed in operation despite the censors and growing pressure . the group worked with the united nations development program to conduct a nationwide survey on sexuality and gender in 2015 , aiming to provide a baseline on the hardships that face lgbtq people living in china . the survey asked respondents about their access to social services , health care , and how societal attitudes affected them . \\\\n in recent years , the group has focused on workplace diversity and inclusion . last week , the center posted an article celebrating 15 years of work . “ beijing lgbt never had much money , and very few staffers , it was all dependent on hundreds of volunteers , ” the article read . \\\\n “ their shutdown makes one feel very helpless . as groups large and small shut down or stop hosting events , there ’s no longer a place where one can see hope , ” said another chinese activist who requested anonymity for fear of government retribution .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Beijing LGBT Center shuttered as crackdown grows in China\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"nbcnews.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna84708\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"8e4088ec3e08d013-bdd5b79e64508706\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":2,\\\"index\\\":2}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"好多年了，中国大地上刮起了一股宣传同性恋的妖风，广州同性恋者还打着女拳的旗号公然上街闹事。消息来了：中国各大高校LGBT社团运营多年的微信公众号被集体注销!\\\\n以下是此次被清理公众号的不完整名单：\\\\n原来这些鼓噪同性恋者不是个人行为，而是背后有庞大的组织在支持。而且这些组织还藏在中国有名的大学里!\\\\n再看美国大使馆年复一年、日复一日的用汉语在中国宣传同性恋，才知道同性恋的妖风兴起的背景非常复杂。不用说，这是打着人权旗号，企图用同性恋让中国断子绝孙恶毒计划。\\\\n可是，通过组织形式进行宣传，推广同性恋，就是教唆他人绝后代 。让人诧异的这样的组织竟然隐藏在“传道、受业、解惑”的顶尖的高等学府!\\\\n堂堂的高等学府，拿着劳动者贡献的教学经费，却搞起了同性恋和性教育。对照宪法，这种毒害下一代的性教育、同性恋教育的法律依据在哪里?\\\\n所幸的是，国家终于出手了，注销了各大高校LGBT社团运营多年的微信公众号。\\\\n\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"取缔同性恋组织，大快人心! -

it started as a safe space for the community to host events . then it became an advocacy group aiming to “ improve the living conditions for the sexually diverse community . ” they offered low-cost mental health counseling and published lists of of lgbtq - friendly health professionals . \\\\n throughout its evolving mission , the center hosted public speakers , film screenings and other events . mr. c , who keeps his real name secret to protect his parents ’ privacy , was one of the center ’s featured transgender speakers . mr. c sued his former employers for letting him go after a 8-day trial period . he alleged it was because of his gender expression . they also hosted liu peilin , a transgender woman in her 60 s , who spoke about being mocked online for dressing in women ’s clothes . \\\\n groups like the beijing lgbt center continued to publicly push for rights such as same - sex marriage even after a nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists that started in 2015 after xi came to power . \\\\n in the past few years , that limited space has shrunk further . \\\\n the well - known group called lgbt rights advocacy china , which brought strategic lawsuits to push for policy change and expanding rights , closed down in 2021 . the group ’s founder was detained and the organization ’s end was a condition of his release , according to an activist close to the group who was previously based in china but has since relocated abroad . he declined to be named out of fear of government retribution toward family in china . \\\\n in face of the constant pressure , he said , sometimes groups are not able to openly inform the community they serve about politically sensitive events they held , which would cause confusion . \\\\n before the crackdown , lgbt rights advocacy china built a network of lawyers who were sympathetic and willing to help lgbtq people with legal issues . they had several visible nationwide campaigns pushing for policy changes , such as recognizing same - sex marriage , through targeted lawsuits . \\\\n police pressure on rights groups increased in the past few years , the activist said . police often invited lgbtq groups to “ drink tea ” — a euphemism for unofficial meetings that police use to keep track of certain targets . that used to happen in public spaces , but started taking place in private spaces , such as directly in front of activists ’ homes . police also started taking activists to the police station for these “ teas , ” the activist said . \\\\n lgbtq organizations often don’t officially register , as it is difficult for them to get government approval , and officially registered groups that partner with them have also came under pressure . sometimes groups , especially small ones , are shut down without an opportunity to tell the public , the activist said . \\\\n “ the ones we’ve seen aren’t just these few , but actually the majority have shut down , ” the activist said . “ the pressure has continuously grown . it ’s never stopped . ” \\\\n in july 2021 , wechat shut down dozens of accounts with lgbtq topics that were run by university students and nonprofit groups . in response , some groups changed their names , removing words that like “ gay ” or “ sexual minority ” that would easily trigger the censors , though it was largely ineffective . \\\\n until monday , the beijing lgbt center stayed in operation despite the censors and growing pressure . the group worked with the united nations development program to conduct a nationwide survey on sexuality and gender in 2015 , aiming to provide a baseline on the hardships that face lgbtq people living in china . the survey asked respondents about their access to social services , health care , and how societal attitudes affected them . \\\\n in recent years , the group has focused on workplace diversity and inclusion . last week , the center posted an article celebrating 15 years of work . “ beijing lgbt never had much money , and very few staffers , it was all dependent on hundreds of volunteers , ” the article read . \\\\n “ their shutdown makes one feel very helpless . as groups large and small shut down or stop hosting events , there ’s no longer a place where one can see hope , ” said another chinese activist who requested anonymity for fear of government retribution .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Beijing LGBT Center shuttered as crackdown grows in China\\\",\\\"pos_rune\\\":[669],\\\"tag_title\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"search_empty\\\":0,\\\"start_index\\\":0}\"}]},\"message_id\":\"1901982490753282\",\"local_message_id\":\"2f6e1490-0120-11f0-a2bf-99ea6f66b78c\",\"conversation_id\":\"1909007789769474\",\"local_conversation_id\":\"local_6124534112214861\",\"section_id\":\"1909007789769730\",\"reply_id\":\"1901982490753026\",\"is_delta\":true,\"status\":4,\"input_content_type\":2001,\"message_index\":2,\"bot_id\":\"7338286299411103781\"}","event_id":"25","event_type":2001}

standing organizations serving sexual and gender minorities in the country — has announced its shutdown after celebrating its 15th anniversary in february and surviving multiple waves of governmental clamp downs on lgbtq spaces . \\\\n the abrupt announcement of disbandment was posted to the group ’s official wechat account this morning , only two days before the international day against homophobia , biphobia and transphobia ( idahobit ) , which commemorates the world health organization ’s 1990 decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder . \\\\n in the shocking post , the organization said that it had ceased all operations as of today , citing unidentified external factors out of its control . “ thank you for following and supporting us over the years , ” the statement reads . “ we kindly ask for your understanding for any inconvenience caused . we hope everything will work well for you in the future . ” \\\\n the center added that for people who had paid to attend its events , refunds would be processed by may 26 . for those who had donated to the organization , they could request information about how their donations will be handled . \\\\n founded in 2008 , the beijing - based organization was a prominent lgbtq advocacy group that fought tirelessly for queer rights and provided a vibrant space for members of the community to connect . one of the group ’s first achievements involved educating psychologists in china about conversion therapy , a dangerous practice that targets lgbtq youth and seeks to change their sexual or gender identities . in 2014 , the center played a catalyzing role in launching china ’s first lgbtq impact litigation case , helping a gay man win a lawsuit against a practitioner of electroshock conversion therapy . \\\\n despite tightening restrictions on queer activism in china over the years of its existence , the center managed to spearhead a variety of influential initiatives , including organizing educational programs geared toward trans healthcare , setting up speed - dating events for queer people , and compiling information on lgbtq - friendly clinics . \\\\n “ the center was so many things : a hub , a refuge , a flagship , a festival , ” darius longarino , a research scholar at the yale law school ’s paul tsai center , who has worked extensively with experts in china seeking to advance lgbtq rights , told the china project . “ they provided services to the community like mental health counseling and hiv testing and ran myriad activities like film screenings , exhibitions , english corners , parties , and discussion groups on coming out and intimacy — and so much more . ” \\\\n “ over the years , countless people came through the center to participate in its life and work in some way . they touched many lives and left beautiful memories , ” he added . \\\\n stephanie yingyi wang , an assistant professor of gender and sexuality studies at st. lawrence university , told the china project that the center was special in that it provided “ a regular physical meeting place for queer people ” in the country . \\\\n “ a lot of the past participants became volunteers and even staff , ” wang , who has worked with the organization on various initiatives , said . “ its closure is indicative of the dying of these kinds of community spaces for queer people in china , because the center had been a beacon for many people , especially younger people in smaller cities and rural areas , to seek refuge . ” \\\\n in a country where lgbtq -

standing organizations serving sexual and gender minorities in the country — has announced its shutdown after celebrating its 15th anniversary in february and surviving multiple waves of governmental clamp downs on lgbtq spaces . \\\\n the abrupt announcement of disbandment was posted to the group ’s official wechat account this morning , only two days before the international day against homophobia , biphobia and transphobia ( idahobit ) , which commemorates the world health organization ’s 1990 decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder . \\\\n in the shocking post , the organization said that it had ceased all operations as of today , citing unidentified external factors out of its control . “ thank you for following and supporting us over the years , ” the statement reads . “ we kindly ask for your understanding for any inconvenience caused . we hope everything will work well for you in the future . ” \\\\n the center added that for people who had paid to attend its events , refunds would be processed by may 26 . for those who had donated to the organization , they could request information about how their donations will be handled . \\\\n founded in 2008 , the beijing - based organization was a prominent lgbtq advocacy group that fought tirelessly for queer rights and provided a vibrant space for members of the community to connect . one of the group ’s first achievements involved educating psychologists in china about conversion therapy , a dangerous practice that targets lgbtq youth and seeks to change their sexual or gender identities . in 2014 , the center played a catalyzing role in launching china ’s first lgbtq impact litigation case , helping a gay man win a lawsuit against a practitioner of electroshock conversion therapy . \\\\n despite tightening restrictions on queer activism in china over the years of its existence , the center managed to spearhead a variety of influential initiatives , including organizing educational programs geared toward trans healthcare , setting up speed - dating events for queer people , and compiling information on lgbtq - friendly clinics . \\\\n “ the center was so many things : a hub , a refuge , a flagship , a festival , ” darius longarino , a research scholar at the yale law school ’s paul tsai center , who has worked extensively with experts in china seeking to advance lgbtq rights , told the china project . “ they provided services to the community like mental health counseling and hiv testing and ran myriad activities like film screenings , exhibitions , english corners , parties , and discussion groups on coming out and intimacy — and so much more . ” \\\\n “ over the years , countless people came through the center to participate in its life and work in some way . they touched many lives and left beautiful memories , ” he added . \\\\n stephanie yingyi wang , an assistant professor of gender and sexuality studies at st. lawrence university , told the china project that the center was special in that it provided “ a regular physical meeting place for queer people ” in the country . \\\\n “ a lot of the past participants became volunteers and even staff , ” wang , who has worked with the organization on various initiatives , said . “ its closure is indicative of the dying of these kinds of community spaces for queer people in china , because the center had been a beacon for many people , especially younger people in smaller cities and rural areas , to seek refuge . ” \\\\n in a country where lgbtq - related research is hard to conduct competently due to the sensitivity of the topic , the center was able to work with forward - looking scholars and institutions to carry out large - scale surveys about the lives of queer individuals in china , such as a 2017 survey with peking university on the mental health of transgender chinese people . these reports , according to longarino , “ crucially filled an information void and have been continuously cited by journalists , activists , and academics . ” \\\\n although china decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 , living in a truly accepting and inclusive society still remains a distant dream for the chinese lgbtq community . same -

LGBT - related organizations have faced growing pressure due to the particularity of their work. The Beijing LGBT Center had also experienced challenges such as forced relocations, cancellations or postponements of activities, and slander of team members, which gradually made its operations difficult.\\n- **Difficulty in Obtaining Official Approval**: It is difficult for LGBT - related organizations to get official approval for registration in China. Without legal registration, they may face more obstacles and uncertainties in their operations, including restrictions on funding sources,场地 use, and activity organization.\\n- **Social and Cultural Factors**: China has its own unique social and cultural background, and traditional values still play an important role in society. Although China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from the list of mental disorders in 2001, same - sex marriage has not been legally recognized, and there is still a certain degree of social prejudice and discrimination against sexual minorities. Under such circumstances, the space for LGBT - related organizations to carry out activities is relatively limited.\\n- **Shift in Policy Focus**: In recent years, the Chinese government has been focusing on promoting social stability, harmony, and the core socialist values. Policies and regulations have been continuously improved to guide the healthy development of society. In this context, some activities and advocacy work of LGBT - related organizations may be inconsistent with the current policy direction and social atmosphere, resulting in a lack of a suitable development environment.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the closure of the Beijing LGBT Center is the result of multiple factors.
