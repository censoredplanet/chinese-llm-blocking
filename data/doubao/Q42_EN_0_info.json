This is the most sensitive and core issue that undermines Sino-US relations.- **South China Sea Dispute**: The US has carried out military provocations in the South China Sea under the pretext of \"freedom of navigation\", and has taken sides with some Southeast Asian countries that have disputes with China in the South China Sea, attempting to contain China and disrupt regional stability.- **Establishment of Military Alliances**: The US has strengthened military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region, such as the Quad and AUKUS, and tried to form a containment network against China, which has increased military confrontation risks in the Asia-Pacific region.### Economic and Trade Frictions- **Trade Protectionism**: The US has imposed high tariffs on Chinese goods under various pretexts, triggering a trade war. It has also restricted Chinese companies' access to the US market and investment in the US, causing significant damage to bilateral trade relations.- **Technological \"Decoupling\"**: The US has implemented export controls and technology blockades on China in high-tech fields such as semiconductors, 5G, and artificial intelligence, established mechanisms like the \"Chip 4 Alliance\", and tried to exclude China from the global high-tech supply chain, which has seriously affected Sino-US technological cooperation and normal economic and trade exchanges.- **\"Decoupling\" and \"De-risking\" Theories**: The US government has proposed \"decoupling\" and \"de-risking\" from China in the economic field. Although claiming that \"de-risking\" is not \"decoupling\", in practice, it has taken a series of measures that have the effect of \"decoupling\", disrupting the normal cooperation order of the global industrial chain and supply chain.### Ideological and Cultural Differences- **Ideological Gap**: The US, adhering to the ideology of liberal democracy, has long tried to impose its values and political system on other countries. It has a deep ideological prejudice against China's socialist system and has smeared and attacked China on issues such as human rights and democracy.- **Cultural Differences**: The cultural traditions, values and ways of thinking of the US and China are quite different. These differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations in communication and cooperation, adding unnecessary obstacles to bilateral relations.### Differences in International Order Concepts- **US Hegemony**: The US attempts to maintain its global hegemony and is reluctant to see the rise of other powers. It has always viewed China's development and growing influence as a threat to its hegemony and has tried to maintain its dominant position in international affairs by containing China.- **Rules and Order**: The US claims to uphold the \"rules-based international order\", but in fact, it often violates international law and basic norms of international relations, and attempts to use its own \"rules\" to restrict and suppress other countries. China, on the other hand, advocates building a community with a shared future for mankind and promoting the construction of a fairer and more equitable international order, which is in conflict with the US's concept of international order.",
