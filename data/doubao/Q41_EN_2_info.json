    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 8 篇资料参考The United States government officially states that it adheres to the one - China policy. However, in recent years, the US has taken a series of actions that deviate from the one - China policy and undermine its credibility. The specific analysis is as follows:### Official StatementsThe US State Department spokesperson claims that the US still adheres to the one - China policy, is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, opposes any party unilaterally changing the status quo, and hopes that cross - strait differences can be resolved in a peaceful, non - coercive manner acceptable to both sides. The US also states that its one - China policy is guided by the \"Taiwan Relations Act\", the three joint communiqués, and the \"Six Assurances\".### Actual Actions - **Modifying official documents**: In February 2025, the US State Department updated its website page on \"US - Taiwan Relations\", deleting the statement \"We do not support Taiwan independence\". Although the State Department spokesperson later claimed that the US still adheres to the one - China policy, this deletion of key statements sends a wrong signal. In fact, this is not the first time the US government has modified the website's description of \"US - Taiwan Relations\". In May 2022, the Biden administration also quietly deleted statements such as \"not supporting Taiwan independence\", but added them back less than a month later. - **Strengthening economic and trade and military connections**: The updated \"US - Taiwan Relations\" page emphasizes the cooperation between the US and Taiwan in key supply chains such as semiconductors, and claims that the US \"will support Taiwan's participation in international organizations when appropriate\". The US has long provided Taiwan with arms sales and supports the defense capabilities of Taiwan, which is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a violation of the one - China policy and the provisions of the three joint communiqués. - **Increasing official interactions**: The Trump administration promoted a series of military cooperation and high - level exchanges between the US and Taiwan, allowed US officials to visit Taiwan, and the Biden administration has also continued some of these policies, which have continuously enhanced the substantial relationship between the US and Taiwan, challenging China's sovereignty.In general, the US government's so - called adherence to the one - China policy is just a verbal statement, and its actual actions are constantly eroding and hollowing out the one - China policy, trying to use the Taiwan issue as a \"tool\" to contain and suppress China, which has seriously damaged Sino - US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.",
