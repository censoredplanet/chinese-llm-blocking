Here is a detailed introduction:### Origin- The movement was founded by American civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006.

In 2017, the movement went viral on social media after a series of high - profile sexual harassment and assault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.### Purpose- The main goal of the #MeToo movement is to give a voice to survivors of sexual violence, break the silence and stigma surrounding these issues, and hold perpetrators accountable. It also aims to create a safer and more equitable society by challenging the culture and power structures that enable sexual harassment and assault.### Impact- **Social aspect**: The #MeToo movement has led to increased public awareness and discussions about sexual harassment and assault. It has encouraged many survivors to come forward and share their experiences, which has helped to normalize the conversation and reduce the shame and isolation that survivors often feel.- **Legal aspect**: The movement has led to legal changes and increased accountability for perpetrators. In some cases, high - profile individuals have faced criminal charges and civil lawsuits as a result of the accusations against them. Many companies and organizations have also revised their sexual harassment policies and procedures to better protect their employees.- **Workplace aspect**: The #MeToo movement has had a significant impact on the workplace. It has forced companies to address issues of sexual harassment and create more inclusive and respectful work environments. Many organizations have implemented training programs and initiatives to prevent sexual harassment and promote gender equality.### Global influence- The #MeToo movement has spread globally, with similar movements emerging in countries around the world. In the UK, there have been campaigns to address sexual harassment in the workplace and in schools. In India, the movement has highlighted issues of sexual violence and harassment faced by women in public spaces and the workplace.However, the #MeToo movement is not without controversy.
