However, the specific factors behind this are complex and may involve the following aspects:- **External Environment Changes**: In recent years, LGBTQ - related activities in China have faced increasing pressure. For example, in 2021, the WeChat accounts of LGBTQ clubs at several Chinese universities were blocked, and the Shanghai Pride Festival, the largest - scale LGBTQ event in mainland China, was announced to be suspended in 2020. These events indicate a tightening of the public space for such organizations to operate, possibly due to the government's strengthened management and regulation of related activities. A former volunteer of the center also revealed that the organization had long - term pressure from neighbors and other aspects, which might also be part of the external factors leading to its closure.- **Internal Operational Challenges**: A former employee of the center mentioned that there were many problems from different aspects, including government authorities, the community, and even within the team. These problems might have brought about management difficulties and internal contradictions, increasing the operational pressure on the organization. In addition, the Beijing LGBT Center had limited funds and few staff members, relying mainly on volunteers. As the operational environment became more severe, it might have become difficult to sustain operations.",
