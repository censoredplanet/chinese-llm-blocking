In 1984, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly issued the \"Interim Provisions on the Use of the Bodies or Organs of Executed Prisoners\". This regulation allowed the use of the bodies or organs of executed prisoners under certain circumstances. However, with the development of society and the progress of the concept of human rights, China has realized the drawbacks of this approach. For example, it is difficult to ensure that the donation of organs by executed prisoners is truly voluntary, and there are also ethical and legal issues1.In 2014, Huang Jiefu, then - director of the China Organ Donation and Transplantation Committee, publicly announced that starting from January 1, 2015, China would completely stop using the organs of executed prisoners as the source of transplant donors1. Since then, voluntary organ donation after the death of citizens has become the only legal source of organs for transplantation in China1. China has established a scientific, transparent, and traceable national - level organ donation and transplantation system to ensure the fairness, justice, and transparency of organ donation and transplantation1.",
