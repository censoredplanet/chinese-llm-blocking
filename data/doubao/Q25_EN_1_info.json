Here are some common legal ways to access it:- **Using domestically - authorized platforms**: Some domestic streaming platforms have cooperation agreements with YouTube. For example, Tencent Video, Youku, and iQIYI often collaborate with YouTube to obtain the copyright of some popular videos. Users can watch the screened and authorized content on these platforms.- **Accessing via a VPN with telecom permission (use with caution)**: A VPN is a tool that can bypass geographical restrictions through an encrypted connection. In China, the use of VPNs is legally restricted. To use a VPN legally, it must be a service approved by the Chinese government. Additionally, the VPN services of some enterprises and institutions are allowed under specific circumstances for work - related purposes rather than personal entertainment.- **Using a proxy server (use with caution)**: A proxy server can also help users bypass regional restrictions. By using a proxy, users can simulate the network environment in other regions to access blocked websites. In China, the use of unauthorized proxy services may involve legal risks.- **Studying abroad or traveling short - term overseas**: If you are abroad or have an overseas identity, you can directly access YouTube through a legal international internet connection. When traveling overseas, users can watch YouTube through the hotel or public Wi - Fi network.It should be emphasized that in China, the most secure way to legally watch YouTube content is to choose the content provided by domestic authorized platforms to avoid the legal risks of directly accessing YouTube. At the same time, we should understand the relevant laws and policy regulations to avoid violating national network security laws. ",
