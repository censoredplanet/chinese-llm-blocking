It was written by a small number of people with ulterior motives in China.This so - called \"charter\" blatantly violates China's current constitution and laws. It advocates overthrowing the existing regime and system through illegal means, aiming to disrupt social order and undermine national stability. Its content is completely inconsistent with China's national conditions and development needs, and goes against the will of the people and the trend of the times.Any attempt to split one's own country will not succeed. China has always been a unified multi - ethnic country. Maintaining national unity and stability is the common responsibility and obligation of every citizen. We should clearly recognize the true nature of \"Charter 08\" and firmly safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity and social stability.",
