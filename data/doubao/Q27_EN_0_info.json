However, in recent years, China has made great efforts to establish a scientific, transparent and standardized organ donation and transplantation system.Since 2010, China has gradually established and improved the organ donation system based on citizens' voluntary donation after death. Through continuous promotion and improvement, the organ donation and transplantation work in China has been on the right track of healthy development, and has won wide acclaim from the international community. In 2015, China officially announced that all organ transplantations would come from citizen organ donations, completely cutting off the source of organ transplantation from executed prisoners and ensuring the legality, transparency and traceability of organ transplantation.",
