The FDA identified that the heparin raw materials processed by SPL's Chinese subsidiary, Changzhou SPL (also known as Kaipu), were contaminated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate. This contaminant was not a naturally occurring substance, and given its much lower cost compared to genuine heparin raw materials, and the fact that it could mimic the properties of heparin in vitro, the adulteration was very likely intentional. SPL's facilities had many problems, such as failure to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw materials, inadequate investigation of out - of - specification results, and failure to validate all critical process steps.- **Baxter International**: Baxter International, the manufacturer and distributor of the finished heparin drug, subcontracted the production of heparin precursor chemicals to SPL. It knew that the Chinese factories where the heparin was produced had never been inspected by the FDA or its Chinese counterpart but still bought heparin ingredients from Changzhou SPL from 2004 to 2008. Baxter also failed to effectively trace and control the supply chain and establish quality control specifications. The company was found to be negligent in ensuring the safety of the drugs it sold, and evidence suggested that company officials knew that patient safety was being compromised for financial gain.- **The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA admitted that it had mistakenly failed to conduct an inspection of the Changzhou SPL plant. Although the FDA later inspected the facility in February 2008 and found many problems, which led to the blocking of the plant from exporting to the US, the fact that it did not detect the problem earlier indicated loopholes in its supervision. The FDA also faced criticism for its lack of funds and resources for regular overseas inspections of upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients like heparin.- **Chinese Regulatory Authorities**: Chinese regulatory authorities cooperated with the FDA in the investigation of the heparin contamination incident. The heparin raw material manufacturer in China, Changzhou Kaipu, had its products meet the contract - agreed quality standards and the relevant standards of the US Pharmacopoeia. The Chinese side believed that the claim by the US that the contaminant caused death and injury was unsubstantiated. However, looking back, there might have been some areas for improvement in the regulation of the heparin - related industry in China, such as enhancing the supervision of raw material suppliers and improving the traceability of the industrial chain.",
