The following is a detailed introduction:- **Historical basis**: As early as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Taiwan was already an important part of China's territory. In the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the \"Inspection Department\" was set up in Penghu to manage the affairs of Taiwan and Penghu. In 1684, the Qing government established the Taiwan Prefecture, which was subordinate to Fujian Province. In 1885, Taiwan became a provincial administrative region of China. These historical facts clearly show that Taiwan has long been under the jurisdiction of China's central government.- **Legal basis**: In 1943, the Cairo Declaration clearly stated that \"the three great Allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan. They covet no gain for themselves and have no thought of territorial expansion. It is their purpose that Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China\". In 1945, the Potsdam Proclamation reaffirmed that \"The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\" On September 2 of the same year, Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender, accepting the Potsdam Proclamation and promising to \"faithfully fulfill the obligations under the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation\", which legally completed the process of the return of Taiwan's sovereignty to China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, although the Kuomintang - led regime retreated to Taiwan, Taiwan is still an inalienable part of China's territory. The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971 recognized that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate representative of China in the United Nations and expelled the representatives of the Taiwan authorities, further confirming the one - China principle and Taiwan's status as part of China.- **International recognition**: The vast majority of countries in the world recognize that there is only one China, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole China. Based on this, they have established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For example, the United States, in the Sino - US Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, clearly stated that \"The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China. And it recognizes the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China\".
