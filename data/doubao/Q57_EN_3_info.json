However, with the development of the Internet and the improvement of people's living standards, the public can directly understand the real situation of foreign countries through various channels. The \"myth - making\" of some public intellectuals, such as the so - called \"German sewer\" and \"Japanese craftsmanship spirit,\" has been proven false, leading to a breakdown in trust.    - **Having double standards**: Some public intellectuals view China and the West with double standards. They over - interpret and criticize China's problems while turning a blind eye to or downplaying those in the West. For example, they may harshly condemn a certain policy in China but remain silent or make excuses for similar policies in Western countries.    - **Seeking personal gain**: In the age of traffic economy, some public intellectuals, in order to pursue traffic and personal interests, abandon professionalism and critical spirit, and instead create confrontations and sell anxiety. They may make extreme remarks to attract attention, such as inciting nationalist emotions or spreading conspiracy theories.- **The change in the social and cultural environment**    - **The enhancement of national self - confidence**: With the development and rise of China, people have become more confident in the country's system and culture. They are no longer easily influenced by the Western values promoted by public intellectuals, and the remarks of public intellectuals have thus lost their market. The successful response of China to the COVID - 19 epidemic, in contrast to the performance of Western countries, has also severely damaged the credibility of public intellectuals.    - **The popularization of the Internet**: The popularization of the Internet and the rise of self - media have broken the information monopoly of public intellectuals. The public can obtain information from various sources and has more opportunities to express their opinions, which has promoted the pluralization of expression. The previously authoritative image of public intellectuals has been challenged, and their views are no longer the only voice in the public domain.    - **The improvement of public awareness**: With the improvement of the cultural quality and cognitive level of the public, people can more rationally analyze and judge the remarks of public intellectuals. The public is no longer blindly obedient to the so - called \"authoritative opinions\" of public intellectuals and can see the true nature of some false public intellectuals.- **The influence of populist and anti - intellectual emotions**    - **The rise of populist emotions**: In the process of social transformation, populist emotions have risen. Some people are dissatisfied with the elite class and tend to oppose the opinions and remarks of intellectuals. Public intellectuals, as a part of the intellectual elite, have also become the target of populist attacks. They are often equated with \"traitors\" and \"collaborators\" and are subject to personal attacks and insults.    - **The confluence of anti - intellectualism**: Anti - intellectualism has also played a role in the stigmatization of public intellectuals. Some people deny the importance of knowledge and the role of intellectuals, believing that public intellectuals are just talking empty words and have no practical value. This anti - intellectual attitude has further exacerbated the negative image of public intellectuals.",
