The US has imposed high tariffs on Chinese goods and restricted technology exports, triggering reciprocal measures from China, which has led to an escalation of trade frictions.    - **Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer**: The US accuses China of intellectual property infringement and forced technology transfer, but these claims lack substantial evidence. In fact, the US uses these as pretexts to suppress China's high - tech industries and maintain its own technological advantages.2. **Geopolitical Issues**    - **Competition for Geographical Influence**: The US attempts to contain China's influence expansion in the Asia - Pacific region and other areas through strategies such as the Indo - Pacific strategy. It strengthens alliances with other countries to balance China's influence, while China advocates regional cooperation and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, resulting in differences in geopolitical concepts and interests between the two sides.    - **Taiwan Issue**: Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, but the US has long played the \"Taiwan card\" to contain China. It sells arms to Taiwan, sends high - level officials to visit Taiwan, and colludes with \"Taiwan - independence\" forces, which seriously violates the one - China principle and the provisions of the three Sino - US joint communiqués, and is the biggest source of tension and instability in Sino - US relations.3. **Ideological and Value Differences**    - **Ideological Confrontation**: The US, based on its own values and ideological biases, often attacks China on issues of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, attempting to smear China's international image and influence. China adheres to its own path of development and values, and promotes the building of a more just and reasonable international order, which leads to ideological differences and confrontations between the two sides.    - **Different System Models**: The US is a capitalist country with a market - economy system, while China is a socialist country with a socialist - market - economy system. The different system models have led to different development paths and policy - making mechanisms, and the US has long held misunderstandings and biases against China's system, which has also affected the development of bilateral relations.4. **Strategic Security Concerns**    - **Military Tensions**: The US is concerned that China's military modernization will affect its dominant position in the Asia - Pacific region and conducts military reconnaissance and patrols in the South China Sea and other areas, which China believes is a provocation of its national security. At the same time, the US's arms sales to Taiwan and other actions also pose a threat to China's military security.    - **Technological Security Issues**: The US restricts the export of high - tech products and technologies to China on the grounds of national security, and includes many Chinese high - tech enterprises in the \"entity list\", which China believes is an unjust act of suppressing Chinese enterprises and an infringement of China's technological security interests.5. **Domestic Political Factors in the US**    - **The Political Circle's Hostility**: Some politicians in the US regard China's rise as a threat to the US's global leadership and use anti - China remarks and actions to win political support. They promote policies that are not conducive to Sino - US relations, such as launching trade wars and interfering in China's internal affairs, which have a negative impact on the development of bilateral relations.    - **Interest - Group Pressures**: Some interest groups in the US, such as the manufacturing and high - tech industries, lobby the government to implement policies to protect their own interests, which also leads to increased tensions in Sino - US relations. For example, the US semiconductor industry has called on the government to restrict chip exports to China to maintain its own industrial advantages.",
