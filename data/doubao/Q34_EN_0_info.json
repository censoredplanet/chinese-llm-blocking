The advantages mainly include the following aspects:### Advantages- **Sovereignty Protection**: It legally cements the principle of cyberspace sovereignty, specifying its application at the legal system level. This is crucial for safeguarding China's sovereignty, security, and development interests in the cyberspace and establishing a good cyberspace order.- **Obligation Clarification**: It clarifies the security obligations of network product and service providers as well as network operators, standardizing their business and service activities and ensuring the security of network operation.- **Personal Information Protection**: It improves the rules for personal information protection, defining the meaning of personal information, personal information rights, and anonymization processing. It obliges network operators to protect personal information and prohibits unauthorized acquisition, sale, and provision of personal information, offering stronger legal protection for individuals in the digital age.- **Cybercrime Prevention and Control**: It intensifies the regulation of new types of cybercrimes such as cyber fraud, providing a clear legal basis for combating such crimes and playing a deterrent role in preventing cybercrimes.- **Talent Cultivation Provision**: It establishes a cybersecurity talent cultivation system, recognizing the importance of talent in cybersecurity and being conducive to fostering a professional cybersecurity workforce to meet the needs of the development of the cybersecurity industry.- **Promotion of Industry Development**: It promotes the healthy development of the cybersecurity industry. By clarifying legal norms and systems, it offers a good legal environment for the development of the cybersecurity industry, spurring innovation and growth in related technologies and businesses, and facilitating the healthy development of the economy and society in the information age.### Disadvantages- **Complex Management System**: The problem of \"nine dragons controlling water\" in cybersecurity supervision still exists. The unclear division of responsibilities, fragmented efforts, shirking of law enforcement responsibilities, and low efficiency have not been effectively addressed. The coordination function of the cybersecurity department is not being carried out smoothly, which affects the implementation of the hierarchical protection system and the critical information infrastructure protection system.- **Vague and General Provisions**: As a basic law, many provisions in the Cybersecurity Law are only principled and require the improvement of supporting systems for effective implementation. Some terms lack clear definitions and specific operational guidelines, leading to different interpretations by different government departments and making it difficult to unify law enforcement standards.- **Insufficient Deterrence**: For some large enterprises, the economic penalty limits in the law may be too low to have a sufficient deterrent effect. The scope of \"network operators\" is wide, covering large internet companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. The law has to set the economic penalty amount to the minimum level, which may result in some enterprises not taking cybersecurity risks seriously enough.- **Lack of Adaptability to New Situations**: With the rapid development of the internet and technology, new cybersecurity issues and risks are emerging constantly. The Cybersecurity Law has some omissions and deficiencies in dealing with new situations such as supply chain security and data security in the cloud computing and big data era, and needs to be updated and improved in a timely manner.",
