: definition and meaning \\\\n on this page : \\\\n definition \\\\n proletariat vs. the bourgeoisie \\\\n implications beyond marxism \\\\n examples \\\\n the proletariat is the working class or lower class in society who live solely from selling their labor power and do not own the means of production . they are viewed in marxism as the revolutionary class with the potential to overturn capitalism . \\\\n key takeaways \\\\n the proletariat are a class of people who , in the view of marx , compose the majority of society . they sell their ability to do work and their labor in order to survive . \\\\n unlike the bourgeoisie , the proletarian class do not own the means of production . karl marx considered this dynamic to be one of exploitation , where the bourgeoisie absorb the value of the goods and services that the proletariat produce without paying this value back to them . \\\\n although the marxist conception of the proletariat is one based on ownership of the means of production , later sociologists have often defined the proletariat along the lines of social class . \\\\n the terms em bourgeoisement and proletarianization refer to processes through which employees come to own the means of production and employers come to lose these means and work for employers , respectively . \\\\n false class consciousness means the way that the proletariat are led to believe their oppression by the bourgeoise is normal , and that if they work hard they can become the bourgeoisie . \\\\n definition \\\\n in marxism , the proletariat is a class of people that composes the majority of society . the proletariat are distinguished from the upper class — the bourgeoisie . in marxism , the term proletariat refers to the workers who are the relations of production and are oppressed by the bourgeoise minority . \\\\n marxism primer \\\\n the first people to write about the idea were marx and engels ( 2012 ) , the originators of the communist manifesto and the populizers of communist theory . \\\\n communist theory , according to marx , is based on the observation that contemporary human societies are capitalist in nature and that capitalism predisposes societies to unjust systems favoring a small group of people , the ruling class bourgeoisie , over the majority , the working class proletariat . \\\\n marx proposed that the solution to this exploitation of the proletariat was to establish a system where workers could take control of their own labor and have access to a fair share of the profits that resulted from their work . \\\\n in a capitalist society , the proletariat is legally free and \\\\n separated from the means of production . the proletariat does not receive the value of the goods that their labor produces but only the cost of subsistence . \\\\n how did marx and engels define the proletariat ? \\\\n the term proletariat dates back to the latin term proleta rius in reference to people who did not own the means of production . the proletarii were people who made up a class by virtue of their lack of property ownership ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n engels illustrated the image of the proletariat as a class in his study of the working class in manchester in 1833 , which happened concurrently with marx ’s discovery of the proletariat on the streets of paris . proletarians literally have nothing to sell but their labor power . \\\\n in an image associated more frequently with the rhetoric of radical communist organizations in the early twentieth century , they are “ wage slaves , ” a term that connected them directly back to the idea of the proletariat in ancient rome . \\\\n in marxism , there was no third strategy available to people under capitalism : either someone owns capital , or they work for it ( ritzer , 2016 ) . \\\\n by 1848 , the concept of the proletariat had become the center of the communist manifesto . marx and engels reached back to ancient times to legitimize the claim that class struggle is the driving force in history , even if it also implied that the contemporary struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariat would be the last struggle that would inaugurate socialism ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n however , marx largely popularized the term . historically , the proletariat emerged as the aristocracy began to suffer financial difficulties in the late middle ages . many of the people who supported themselves working for the aristocracy lost their livelihoods . \\\\n the use of enclosures ( such as fences ) , which changed how people could use land in agriculture , and denying peasants access to common lands and resources , landowners were able to transfer their land into pasture land for sheep , or sold it to farmers who could develop grain and livestock production . \\\\n the people who had subsisted on the land ceased to be able to do so – in the literal sense of proletariat , they became property less . \\\\n at the same time , population growth skyrocketed and forced labor — such as slavery and indentured servitude — was prevalent . \\\\n factory production also began to undermine rural industry and craft production in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . again , this created a large class of people without land or property who had to join companies — such as factories — to survive . \\\\n these people became free wage laborers who were free from both feudal ties and a source of livelihoods ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n marx showed how the relationship between workers and capitalists and labor and capital is , beyond merely an economic relationship between equals , exploitative and contradictory . \\\\n marx also believed that the bourgeoisie capitalists and the proletariat workers were directly opposed to each other . at the same time , he considered them to be partners in the sense that both capital and labor are required in production . \\\\n marx proposed that this contradictory relationship in capitalism has class conflict built into it , leading to strikes , crises , political struggles and , ultimately , the overthrowing of bourgeois rule by the proletariat . \\\\n proletariat vs. the bourgeoisie \\\\n the proletariat itself has a number of characteristics . the most important of these is their lack of property and lack of ownership of the means of production . \\\\n in marxism , products and services can only be produced when someone has access to both the means of production — all of the equipment and materials required to create goods or services , and labor . all of these factors are called factors of production ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n because they do not have access to the means of production , the proletariat must work under the bourgeoisie to subsist and survive . \\\\n the proletariat , working under marx ” s definition , have these characteristics : \\\\n they lack ownership of the means of production ; \\\\n they constitute the majority of capitalist society ; \\\\n they effectively sell their time and labor for subsistence ; \\\\n in selling their time and labor for subsistence , they are not entitled to the full value of the goods and services they produce . \\\\n implications beyond marxism \\\\n the idea of the proletariat — and the predictions of max — would come to become a major issue in the history of twentieth - century sociology . \\\\n marx and engels argued that the logic of capitalist development means that the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes would inevitably consolidate , meaning that the vast majority of people would become proletarians , and a small group , the bourgeoisie . \\\\n the theorists believed that the middle class , petty bourgeoisie , small producers , and retailers , would be redistributed across the ranks of the two major classes , causing their numbers to diminish . \\\\n small proprietors would become less common as they lose out in the fierce competition from large proprietors . \\\\n additionally , workers skilled in using hand tools would also become less common as capitalists replaced them with cheaper unskilled workers operating machines . \\\\n additionally , since the persistence of the capitalist mode of production is accompanied by economic downturns , marx believed that wages would fall while the percentage of unemployed workers rose ( ritzer , 2016 ) . \\\\n later , reformist marxists believed that the growth of the proletariat would lead to the voting out of the bourgeoisie of government . nonetheless , marx ’s later work predicted the emergence on the horizon of new middle - class workers such as schoolteachers and factory inspectors . \\\\n examples \\\\n marx and engels case studies \\\\n the image of the proletariat has had many faces throughout time . stalinism , as promoted by the forced industrialization of the soviet union , saw the face of the proletariat as masculine . \\\\n meanwhile , the west often saw the proletariat as those working for large corporations , such as ford . marx ” s original work , das kapital , however , paints a different picture . \\\\n his figures of the proletariat include a boy named william wood , a 9 year old who works 15 hours a day while earning an extremely small sum — three shillings and sixpence — and mary anne walkley , a 20 - year - old girl who dies after working 26 hours straight with 50 girls in a room that afforded each worker a third of the cubic feet of air required for them . \\\\n marx ” s proletariat , in the view of ritzer ( 2016 ) was largely that of socially produced poverty . \\\\n engels similarly charted the condition of the working class in england in the 1840s through personal observation and authentic sources . \\\\n he postulated that there would be proletarian violence during economic downturns and maintained that each new economic crisis would be accompanied by even more violence . \\\\n two decades after engels , marx sought to create a general law of capitalist accumulation through uk government statistics . while the production of coal and iron had increased , more railway tracks were in use , and exports had boomed and profits grew , the numbers on the official lists of the very poor “ paupers ” increased . \\\\n into the twentieth century in the west , the working class became integrated into society following the postwar boom . members of the traditional proletariat — factory workers — largely de unioned and became more disorganized . \\\\n although the working class still existed — with the vast majority of people needing to sell their labor power in one way or another — these people worked a more diverse set of occupations than ever before . \\\\n ritzer argues ( 2016 ) that , in the latter half of the twentieth century , a new category emerged : the precariat , who sought to envelop often well - qualified and highly skilled non - manual workers who were unable to find work . \\\\n as unions largely diminished , employers began to offer temporary contracts to many laborers , resulting in “ precarious ” employment where workers still did not own the means of production . \\\\n em bourgeoisement \\\\n in the early 1900 s , eduard bernstein pointed out that wages had increased ( year ; ultee , 2007 ) . he pointed out the rise of better - paid skilled labor necessary for the operation and construction of machines . \\\\n he also predicted that labor unionization , the introduction of rites to vote for all adult citizens , and the increasing voting base of social democratic parties would lead to the gradual reform of capitalism . \\\\n post world war ii , revisionists predicted that rising standards of living would result in the em bourgeoisement of the working class — a process where people in the proletariat become financially affluent and internalize and reproduce behaviors , norms , and values associated with the middle - class ( rinehart , 1971 ) . \\\\n proletarianization \\\\n the flip - size of em bourgeoisement is proletarianization . in marxism , proletarianization is the social process through which non - manual work comes increasingly to resemble manual work , and non - manual workers adopt the attitudes of the working class . \\\\n proletarianization is seen as downward social mobility — a process that prohibits a proletarianized person from accumulating capital ( wright \\\\u0026 singelmann , 1982 ) . \\\\n evidence used to support proletarianization includes the greater unionization associated with white - collar ( suit - and - tie ) workers and their willingness to

' ' scholars used this term for the contemporary industrial worker class because of the strong socio - economic similarities between the two groups . karl marx and friedrich engels popularized the term in their highly influential communist manifesto . they argued that the proletariat had been manipulated and taken advantage of for far too long . \\\\n karl marx called continuously for a proletariat revolution in the communist manifesto which he wrote with friedrich engels . \\\\n friedrich engels called continuously for a proletariat revolution in the communist manifesto which he wrote with karl marx . \\\\n the proletariat and the bourgeoisie \\\\n who are the proletariat , and who are the opposite of the proletariat ? \\\\n marx and engels conceptualized history as a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie . \\\\n ' ' freeman and slave , patrician and plebeian , lord and serf , guild - master and journeyman , in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another . ' ' - communist manifesto \\\\n this battle had been fought constantly for centuries under different titles and in different contexts . despite these nuances , the groups on both sides of this economic , political , and religious conflict retained the characteristics of their predecessors . to express their ideas , marx and engels used specific terms for four groups of people in their model . their use of these terms is distinct from , although related to , the use of these terms in previous time periods . \\\\n these terms are : \\\\n bourgeoisie : the ruling or upper and middle classes of society . including rulers , government bureaucrats , and business owners . \\\\n marx and engels regarded the bourgeoisie as being the supreme enemy of the proletariat , working completely opposite and against them . they were the ' ' oppressors . ' ' they purposely alienated their employees from the products they created to keep morale down and maintain the proletariat 's dependence on factory labor for the means to live . all of this was done to maintain the prominence of the bourgeoisie . \\\\n according to marx and engels , the french revolution was one that favored the bourgeoisie and was symptomatic of western societies becoming more capitalist . the bourgeoisie also had an important role to play in the necessary proletariat revolution conceived of by marx and engels , but they were fairly certain that they would refuse to help the proletariat , who they viewed as being beneath them . \\\\n ' ' the bourgeoisie , historically , has played a most revolutionary part . the bourgeoisie , wherever it has got the upper hand , has put an end to all feudal , patriarchal , idyllic relations . . . . not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself ; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons — the modern working class — the proletarians . ' ' \\\\n petite - bourgeoisie : members of the middle class who are small business owners , especially those who owned family businesses . \\\\n marx and engels referred to the petite - bourgeoisie as a ' ' transitional class ' ' between the oppressors and the oppressed . marx in particular was angered by the petite - bourgeoisie because they persisted in attempting to use solutions other than revolutionary action to solve the problem of oppression . he was also angered because they insisted on remaining in this transitory phase rather than identifying with the proletariat . \\\\n ' ' the lower middle - class , the small manufacture , the shopkeeper , the artisan , the peasant , all these fight against the bourgeoisie , to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class . they are therefore not revolutionary , but . . . reactionary . . . . if by chance they are revolutionary , they are so , only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat , they thus defend not their present , but their future interests , they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat . ' ' \\\\n proletariat : members of the industrial working class , wage - earning workers , who work collectively to better their situation through revolutionary tactics such as labor strikes . \\\\n these were regarded by marx and engels as being the ' ' oppressed . ' ' they claimed that as the workforce behind the success of industrialized societies , the proletariat was more entitled than the bourgeoisie to the profits of their labors . the proletariat is formed of people from all walks of life and all financial classes as industrialization make their skills obsolete . \\\\n ' ' in proportion as the bourgeoisie , i . e . , capital , is developed , in the same proportion is the proletariat , the modern working class , developed , a class of laborers , who live only so long as they find work , and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital . . . . owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labor , the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character . ' ' \\\\n propaganda such as this demonstrated the ideal world , in which the proletariat liberated their countries from the oppression of the bourgeoisie . \\\\n lumpenproletariat : the ' ' dangerous class , ' ' the poorest members of the working class who do not identify as members of the proletariat and therefore do not desire to engage in revolution . \\\\n this term also referred to members of society who were unemployable and not valuable to any part of the community , including tramps and criminals . \\\\n the lumpenproletariat is often hated by socialists because they are seen as class traitors . marx and other socialists believe the lumpenproletariat should be allied with the proletariat , but instead prey on the proletariat and can be paid by the bourgeoisie to engage in counter - revolutionary action . \\\\n ' ' the social scum , that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society , may , here and there , be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution ; its conditions of life , however , prepare it far more to the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue . ' ' \\\\n examples of the proletariat \\\\n the proletariat can include anyone who sells their labor for a wage and does not own a significant stake in the means of production , including industrial workers , agricultural workers , freelancers , office workers ( excluding management and c-level executives ) . throughout history , groups of the self - identified proletariat have acted collectively to achieve their goals in various ways , including labor strikes or revolutionary action . proletariat examples include : \\\\n united states \\\\n in october 2021 , around a hundred thousand workers went on strike for higher wages and better working conditions . strike participants argued that with the covid-19 pandemic affecting the health and safety environments of the workplace as well as the economy , employers should pay their workers more for their labor . as a result of employers ' refusal to increase wages or benefits , mass strikes took place across the country in what became known as ' ' striketober . ' ' workers who participated in the strike came from all sorts of work environments , including kellogg , john deere , denver international airport , and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees . \\\\n china \\\\n perhaps the most famous proletariat uprising besides the bolshevik revolution is the chinese communist revolution in 1949 that resulted in the creation of the people 's republic of china . the chinese communist party had fought against the nationalist party in different iterations since the 1920 s . in 1939 , it united industrial laborers against the bourgeoisie and was successful in garnering the support of many peasants as well , although the bulk of the revolution was carried out in more urban areas . during world war ii , the communist party allowed for more freedom of expression and dissent than the nationalist party , which earned them the sympathy of the public . after world war ii , the widespread corruption of the nationalist government made them lose support among the people , and this lack of morale enabled the people 's republic of china to gain the upper hand and take over the government . mao zedong favored the proletariat labor force over all other classes . for example , in his land allotment program , he insisted that the benefits of this revolution be given primarily to the proletariat rather than the peasant supporters , who were given as little resources as the former bourgeoisie . \\\\n cuba \\\\n the cuban revolution , led by fidel castro , culminated in the formation of a communist government in 1959 . the main revolutionary group was movimiento 26 de julio , a group of middle - class and professional guerillas who were determined on creating an organized revolutionary force . castro joined his group with other liberal forces and led them in furthering communist goals . \\\\n lesson summary \\\\n the proletariat is the industrial working class of society . the unifying characteristic of members of this social class is employment in an industrial company such as a factory . the term comes from ancient rome . the proletarian class of this society was constituted of people who owned less than a certain amount on the roman census . this class was used as a tool of the warring higher classes in roman society , manipulated by ' ' bread and circuses . ' ' \\\\n in their influential communist manifesto , marx and engels conceptualized history as a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie . the four groups that were involved in this struggle , especially at the time of communist russia , were : \\\\n bourgeoisie : the ruling or upper and middle classes of society . including rulers , government bureaucrats , and business owners . \\\\n petite - bourgeoisie : members of the middle class who are small business owners , especially those who owned family businesses . \\\\n proletariat : members of the industrial working class , wage - earning workers , who work collectively to better their situation through revolutionary tactics such as labor strikes . \\\\n lumpenproletariat : the ' ' dangerous class , ' ' the poorest members of the working class who do not identify as members of the proletariat and therefore do not desire to engage in revolution . this term also referred to members of society who were unemployable and not valuable to any part of the community , including tramps and criminals . \\\\n there are many examples of proletariat revolution , including in the united states , cuba , and china . \\\\n frequently asked questions \\\\n what is proletariat and bourgeoisie ? \\\\n the proletariat are industrial workers who have been alienated from the products created by their labor . the bourgeoisie are the factory owners and employers who perform the alienation and profit from the labor of the proletariat . \\\\n are peasants proletariat ? \\\\n peasants are not members of the proletariat . the proletariat consists of factory and other industrial workers who have consistently been taken advantage of and used by factory owners and other members of the bourgeoisie . \\\\n what jobs are proletariat ? \\\\n the proletariat includes industrial workers , agricultural workers , freelancers , and lower - and mid - level office workers . management and c-level executives are excluded from the proletariat . \\\\n are office workers proletariat ? \\\\n lower - and mid - level office workers are included in the proletariat . management and c-level executives are not included in the proletariat , because they hold places of power over their fellow office workers .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Proletariat | Definition \\\\u0026 Examples | Study.com\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"study.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://study.com/learn/lesson/proletariat-concept-history-examples.html\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"5e58efd92c9217e6-44934cc105127b20\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":4}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"proletariat\\\\n听听怎么读\\\\n英 [ˌprəʊləˈteəriət]\\\\n美 [ˌproʊləˈteriət]\\\\n是什么意思\\\\nn.\\\\n（古罗马社会中的）最下层阶级，工人阶级，尤指无产阶级；\\\\n英英释义\\\\nproletariat [ ,prəule'tεəriət ]\\\\nn. a social class comprising those who do manual labor or work for wages\\\\n同义词：laborlabourworking class\\\\n学习怎么用\\\\n词组短语\\\\ndictatorship of the proletariat无产阶级专政\\\\n双语例句\\\\n用作名词(n.)\\\\nThe daily struggle of the proletariat sharpens the instability of bourgeois society.\\\\n工人阶级的日常斗争加剧了资产阶级社会的动荡。\\\\nThe proletariat must possess the truth of Marxism.\\\\n无产阶级必须掌握马克思主义的真理。\\\\nThe peasantry is the firm ally of the proletariat.\\\\n无产阶级的坚固的同盟者是农民。\\\\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat is one of the aim of communism.\\\\n无产阶级专政是共产主义的目标之一。\\\\n权威例句\\\\nAbschied vom Proletariat\\\\nWhite-Collar Proletariat\\\\nDie SPD : vom Proletariat zur Neuen Mitte\\\\nLabour Market Reform and the Plight of the Laid-off Proletariat\\\\nIndividual lives and family strategies in the French proletariat\\\\nProletariat into a Class: The Process of Class Formation from Karl Kautsky's The Class Struggle to Recent Controversies\\\\nIs There a New Service Proletariat?

\\\\n the term proletariat dates back to the latin term proleta rius in reference to people who did not own the means of production . the proletarii were people who made up a class by virtue of their lack of property ownership ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n engels illustrated the image of the proletariat as a class in his study of the working class in manchester in 1833 , which happened concurrently with marx ’s discovery of the proletariat on the streets of paris . proletarians literally have nothing to sell but their labor power . \\\\n in an image associated more frequently with the rhetoric of radical communist organizations in the early twentieth century , they are “ wage slaves , ” a term that connected them directly back to the idea of the proletariat in ancient rome . \\\\n in marxism , there was no third strategy available to people under capitalism : either someone owns capital , or they work for it ( ritzer , 2016 ) . \\\\n by 1848 , the concept of the proletariat had become the center of the communist manifesto . marx and engels reached back to ancient times to legitimize the claim that class struggle is the driving force in history , even if it also implied that the contemporary struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariat would be the last struggle that would inaugurate socialism ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n however , marx largely popularized the term . historically , the proletariat emerged as the aristocracy began to suffer financial difficulties in the late middle ages . many of the people who supported themselves working for the aristocracy lost their livelihoods . \\\\n the use of enclosures ( such as fences ) , which changed how people could use land in agriculture , and denying peasants access to common lands and resources , landowners were able to transfer their land into pasture land for sheep , or sold it to farmers who could develop grain and livestock production . \\\\n the people who had subsisted on the land ceased to be able to do so – in the literal sense of proletariat , they became property less . \\\\n at the same time , population growth skyrocketed and forced labor — such as slavery and indentured servitude — was prevalent . \\\\n factory production also began to undermine rural industry and craft production in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . again , this created a large class of people without land or property who had to join companies — such as factories — to survive . \\\\n these people became free wage laborers who were free from both feudal ties and a source of livelihoods ( darity , 2008 ) . \\\\n marx showed how the relationship between workers and capitalists and labor and capital is , beyond merely an economic relationship between equals , exploitative and contradictory . \\\\n marx also believed that the bourgeoisie capitalists and the proletariat workers were directly opposed to each other . at the same time , he considered them to be partners in the sense that both capital and labor are required in production . \\\\n marx proposed that this contradictory relationship in capitalism has class conflict built into it , leading to strikes , crises , political struggles and , ultimately , the overthrowing of bourgeois rule by the proletariat . \\\\n proletariat vs. the bourgeoisie\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Proletariat: Definition And Meaning\\\",\\\"pos_rune\\\":[207],\\\"tag_title\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"search_empty\\\":0,\\\"start_index\\\":0}\"}]},\"message_id\":\"1866199938458882\",\"local_message_id\":\"8cf67ab0-ffe2-11ef-b964-f94964d9234f\",\"conversation_id\":\"1866753653780994\",\"local_conversation_id\":\"local_7151160801150205\",\"section_id\":\"1866753653781250\",\"reply_id\":\"1866199938458626\",\"is_delta\":true,\"status\":4,\"input_content_type\":2001,\"message_index\":2,\"bot_id\":\"7338286299411103781\"}","event_id":"14","event_type":2001}
