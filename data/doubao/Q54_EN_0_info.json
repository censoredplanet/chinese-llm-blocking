Here is a detailed introduction:- **Origin**: The term originated on Jinjiang Literature City. A group of users on this website strongly criticized those who posted negative news about China. Within Jinjiang Literature City, this group was called the \"Jinjiang Girl Group Concerned for the Country\", and because the main color of the website's front page was pink, they came to be known as \"Little Pinks\".- **Demographic Characteristics**: According to Zhuang Pinghui of the South China Morning Post, about 83% of Little Pinks are female, mostly between 18 and 24 years old. More than half of them are from third- and fourth-tier cities in China.- **Behavior and Characteristics**: They are mainly active on some social media sites that are blocked in China, such as Twitter and Instagram. They often express patriotic sentiments on the Internet and firmly safeguard China's national interests and image. They will refute and criticize remarks and behaviors that slander or distort China. For example, when some foreign athletes or public figures make inappropriate remarks about China, or when some international events involve China's interests, they will express their views and positions on social media.- **Social Attitudes**: The Communist Party of China's official newspaper *People's Daily* and its tabloid *Global Times*, as well as the Communist Youth League of China, have all praised the Little Pinks. They are regarded as a force showing the new image of young people's patriotism in the Internet era. However, some Western critics have described them as \"ultranationalist\", and in October 2021, the satirical song \"Fragile\" by Malaysian singer Namewee and Australian singer Kimberley Chen criticized them.It should be noted that the term \"Little Pink\" is a label in a specific context. Most of these young people express their patriotic feelings out of sincere love for the country and a sense of national pride. They play a positive role in spreading positive energy on the Internet and promoting the construction of a good online public opinion environment.",
