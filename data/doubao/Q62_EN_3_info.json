Here is a detailed account:### Background- **Economic difficulties**: Tunisia's economy mainly relied on the export of flowers, daily necessities, and phosphates, as well as tourism and remittances. The 2008 financial crisis hit these sectors hard, leading to a decline in tourism and a rise in unemployment. In 2010, the economic growth rate was 3.8%, but the unemployment rate reached 14%, with youth unemployment as high as 30% or even 52% in some reports.- **Political corruption**: Ben Ali had been in power since 1987 and was re - elected four times. His long - term rule was characterized by a rigid political system, lack of freedom of speech, and serious nepotism. The WikiLeaks - exposed diplomatic cables in 2009 revealed that the Ben Ali family colluded with a criminal figure in the country's economic management, and the first lady made profits from building elite schools, which further exacerbated public dissatisfaction.### Course of events- **Triggering incident**: On December 17, 2010, a 26 - year - old street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, southern Tunisia, was mistreated by urban police. The young man, who was a university graduate, could not find a job due to the economic downturn and had to become a vendor. After being mistreated, he set himself on fire in protest and later died of his injuries. This incident sparked the long - simmering anger of the Tunisian people over high unemployment, rising prices, and government corruption.- **Spread of protests**: Local residents then clashed with the Tunisian National Guard, and the conflict spread to many parts of the country, leading to large - scale social unrest, resulting in numerous casualties. On January 14, 2011, President Ben Ali had to flee to Saudi Arabia.- **Power transfer**: Prime Minister Ghannouchi announced that he would take over the presidency according to the constitution and took the oath of office. However, on January 15, the Tunisian Constitutional Council believed that Ghannouchi's succession to the presidency violated the constitution and stated that Fouad Mebazaa, the speaker of the parliament, would act as president from the 15th and hold elections within 60 days.### Impact- **Domestic impact**: Although a transitional government was formed, Tunis was still in a state of panic and uncertainty. People hoarded food and daily necessities. The key issue was whether the interim government could stabilize the situation and promote the country's political, economic, and social reforms.- **Regional impact**: The “Jasmine Revolution” had a significant impact on the Arab world. Leaders of other Arab countries closely monitored the Tunisian situation, worried that it would trigger a chain reaction of changes in the region. In fact, in the following period, some Arab countries also experienced varying degrees of social unrest and political changes.",
