The following is the basis for this:- **Historical basis**:    - **Early development and governance**: As early as 230 AD, the people of the Wu State in the Three Kingdoms period reached \"Yizhou\" (now Taiwan). In the Sui Dynasty, the government sent troops to \"Liuqiu\" (now Taiwan) three times. Since the Yuan Dynasty, China has set up administrative institutions in Penghu and Taiwan to exercise effective jurisdiction.    - **Modern history of resistance against foreign aggression**: In 1624, Dutch colonists occupied southern Taiwan and were expelled by national hero Zheng Chenggong in 1662. In 1895, due to the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan. During World War II, China's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression led to the victory that enabled the recovery of Taiwan. The Cairo Declaration in 1943 and the Potsdam Proclamation in 1945 clearly stipulated that Japan must return Taiwan to China.- **Legal basis**:    - **International law**: The Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation and Japan's Unconditional Surrender Instrument have clearly defined that Taiwan belongs to China. These are important international legal documents that cannot be violated.    - **UN resolution**: The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971 clearly stated that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is not a country but an inalienable part of China's territory, and the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of China.- **Political basis**:    - **One-China principle**: It is the universal consensus of the international community and the basic norm of international relations. As of 2024, 181 countries in the world recognize the One-China principle.    - **Domestic law**: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates in its preamble that \"Taiwan is an inalienable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China.\" The Anti-Secession Law also emphasizes that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China.",
