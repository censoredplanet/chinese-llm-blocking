It is based on historical facts and reflects the real experiences, events, and cultural traditions of the group. The following are its main characteristics and components:- **Based on historical facts**: Correct collective memory is firmly grounded in historical truth. It requires that the remembered content be consistent with the actual events that occurred in the past, without distorting or fabricating facts. For example, the collective memory of a nation's historical events, such as wars, revolutions, and cultural heritages, should be based on reliable historical records and research to ensure the authenticity of the memory.- **Reflecting group identity and values**: It is closely related to the identity and values of the social group. It helps the group members to establish a sense of identity and belonging, and to inherit and carry forward the group's cultural traditions and values. For instance, the collective memory of a family may include the stories and virtues of its ancestors, which reflect the family's values and traditions and strengthen the family members' sense of identity and cohesion.- **Promoting social cohesion and development**: Correct collective memory plays a positive role in promoting social cohesion and development. By sharing common memories, group members can enhance their emotional connection and mutual understanding, and thus work together to achieve common goals. In a community or a country, collective memory can inspire people's patriotism and a sense of responsibility, and promote the progress of society.- **Having an open and inclusive attitude**: It should be open and inclusive, able to tolerate different views and interpretations, and continuously absorb new historical materials and research results to enrich and improve itself. As society progresses and changes, collective memory also needs to be updated and refined to adapt to the new situation and needs. For example, in the process of globalization, different cultures and ethnic groups should respect and understand each other's collective memories to promote cultural exchanges and integration.",
