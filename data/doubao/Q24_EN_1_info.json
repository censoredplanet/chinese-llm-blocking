By promptly isolating infected individuals, carrying out mass testing, and implementing strict prevention and control measures, the spread of the virus was effectively curbed, reducing the number of infections and deaths, and safeguarding the health of the public, especially the elderly, children, and those with underlying diseases.- **Maintaining Economic Stability**: On the whole, China's economy maintained an average annual growth rate of about 4.5% during the three - year epidemic period, which was significantly higher than the world average. The zero - COVID policy created a healthier, safer, and more stable environment for China's development. By quickly controlling local outbreaks, it ensured the normal operation of enterprises and maintained the stability of the industrial chain and supply chain. In 2020, China became the only major economy in the world to achieve positive economic growth. In 2021, the added value of industries above designated size in China increased by 9.6% year - on - year, and the total import and export value of goods reached a record high.- **Ensuring the Smooth Operation of Global Supply Chains**: As the world's largest manufacturing country, China has a complete and large - scale industrial system. The zero - COVID policy ensured the normal operation of China's factories and maintained the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain. China has become one of the world's most important production bases, providing a large number of high - quality products for the international market and ensuring the supply of anti - epidemic materials, daily necessities, office supplies, and digital products, which has played a crucial role in maintaining the normal operation of the global economy.- **Gaining Time for Global Epidemic Prevention and Control**: China's strict implementation of the zero - COVID policy has effectively curbed the spread of the virus within its territory, bought precious time for the global vaccination campaign and the improvement of epidemic prevention and control capabilities, and provided valuable experience and reference for the global fight against the epidemic.### Negative Effects- **Impact on Some Industries in the Short Term**: The repeated lockdowns and travel restrictions had a certain impact on some industries, such as the service industry, tourism, and transportation. The tourism industry was hit hard, with a significant decrease in domestic and foreign tourism. The service industry also faced challenges such as reduced consumer demand and business closures. In some affected areas, the production and operation of enterprises were disrupted, and there were problems such as unstable supply chains and reduced production.- **Influence on Employment and Household Income**: The economic slowdown and the impact on some industries led to an increase in unemployment, especially among young people aged 18 - 24. The income of some households also decreased, and people's consumption confidence was affected, resulting in a decrease in consumption. Some migrant workers faced difficulties in finding jobs and returning home due to travel restrictions. ",
