While \"Proletariat\" refers to the working class or the lowest social class who live by selling their labor power and do not own the means of production, \"Cover - Up Class\" is used to describe a group of people who try to hide or suppress information.The term \"Cover - Up Class\" is likely to be used in a satirical or critical context to imply that certain individuals or groups, perhaps in positions of power or with specific interests, attempt to conceal the truth or relevant information from the public. This could be to maintain their power, avoid negative consequences, or promote a particular agenda. Such a usage is a creative twist on the traditional concept of the proletariat, using the similar - sounding \"cover - up\" to highlight the act of hiding information instead of referring to a social and economic class.",
