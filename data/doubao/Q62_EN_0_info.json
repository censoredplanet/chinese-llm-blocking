The details are as follows:### Background- **High Unemployment**: The 2008 financial crisis hit Tunisia's economy hard, causing a decline in tourism and a rise in unemployment. In 2010, Tunisia's economic growth rate was 3.8%, but the unemployment rate was 14%, with youth unemployment possibly as high as 52%.- **Government Corruption**: For a long time, the Ben Ali government in Tunisia had problems such as nepotism and corruption. The WikiLeaks disclosure of U.S. diplomatic cables in 2009 further deepened public dissatisfaction with the government.- **Political Suppression**: During Ben Ali's long tenure, the political system was rigid, personal freedoms were restricted, and the media was under tight control. Although opposition parties nominally existed, in reality, Ben Ali held onto power for a long time.### Course of Events- **Outbreak**: On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, southern Tunisia, was mistreated by city police. The young man, who was a university graduate and had no choice but to become a vendor due to the economic downturn and family financial pressures, set himself on fire in protest. He died from his injuries on January 4, 2011.- **Spread**: The incident sparked conflicts between local residents and the Tunisian National Guard, which then spread to many parts of the country, leading to large-scale social unrest with many casualties.- **Outcome**: On the 29th day after the street vendor set himself on fire, on the night of January 14, 2011, President Ben Ali was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi initially announced that he would take over the presidential powers according to the constitution, but later, the Tunisian Constitutional Council ruled that Ghannouchi's succession was unconstitutional, and Fouad Mebazaa, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, took over the presidential powers instead.### Impact- **Domestic Impact**: The \"Jasmine Revolution\" led to the collapse of Tunisia's original political structure, and the country fell into social turmoil. Long-suppressed religious extremist forces took the opportunity to rise, and many young people were lured to join terrorist organizations, causing a series of terrorist attacks that seriously damaged Tunisia's economy and social stability.- **Regional Impact**: The \"Jasmine Revolution\" set off a wave of political unrest in West Asia and North Africa, known as the \"Arab Spring\", triggering similar protests and political changes in some other Arab countries and having a profound impact on the political landscape of the region.Some Western media and online figures called this upheaval the \"Jasmine Revolution\". However, in fact, it was the result of the long-term accumulation of various social contradictions in Tunisia, which brought serious disasters to the Tunisian people and the entire region, and its negative impact is still being felt today.",
