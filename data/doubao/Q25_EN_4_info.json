Then open the app store on your phone, search for \"YouTube\", select the official app, and click to download and install. After the installation is complete, open the app and register or log in with your account to start using it.- **Using a Browser to Access the Web Version**: If you can't download the app or prefer to use the web version, open a browser on your mobile phone, type \"YouTube\" in the search bar, find the official website, and click to enter. However, due to network and regional factors, there may be issues such as slow loading or lagging. In this case, you can try switching browsers or adjusting the network environment.### Accessing via Computers- **Using a Browser**: Open a browser on your computer, type \"youtube.com\" in the address bar, and press Enter. Click the \"Sign In\" button in the upper - right corner. If you don't have an account, you can click \"Create Account\" to create one. Then enter your email address, phone number, and password as prompted to log in.- **Using a Proxy Server or VPN**: Due to regional access restrictions, you may need to use a proxy server or VPN. A proxy server can disguise your IP address, and a VPN can create a secure encrypted connection to make your network activity appear to be from another location, thus bypassing restrictions to access YouTube. But make sure to choose a reliable and legal service provider to protect your privacy and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.It should be noted that in some regions, accessing YouTube may be restricted by relevant laws, regulations, and policies. When using the above methods, make sure to comply with local laws and regulations and respect intellectual property rights.",
