\\\\n ance of former scarcities which in fact have become impossible \\\\n since the lowering of tariffs and the ease of communications \\\\n allow one country to get from others the supplies it happens to \\\\n need . but the former crises in food supplies have given place to \\\\n commercial and industrial crises that are no less scandalous \\\\n in the disturbance they cause . and the more the dimensions of \\\\n societies increase and the more the markets expand , the greater \\\\n the urgency of some regulation to put an end to this instability . \\\\n because , as discussed earlier , the more the whole exceeds the \\\\n part , the more the society extends beyond the individual , the \\\\n less can the individual sense within himself the social needs and \\\\n the social interests he is bound to take into account . \\\\n now , if these professional ethics are to become established \\\\n in the economic order , then the professional group , hardly to \\\\n i6 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n be found in this sphere of social hfe , must be formed or revived . \\\\n for it is this group alone that can work out a scheme of rules . \\\\n at this point , however , we come up against a historical pro - \\\\n judice . the name in history of this professional group is the \\\\n guild ^ and this guild is held to have been bound up with our \\\\n political ancien regime and therefore as not being able to survive \\\\n it . it appears that to claim a corporate organization for industry \\\\n and commerce would be retrograde and , in principle , such \\\\n re versions are rightly considered as unhealthy phenomena . \\\\n there is , however , a primary fact which should put us on our \\\\n guard against this reasoning , and that is the very long history of \\\\n the guilds . if they only dated from the middle ages we might \\\\n indeed believe that as they had come into existence with the \\\\n political system of those days they had inevitably to pass away \\\\n with it . but they have in fact an origin far more ancient . the \\\\n craft guild has been with us from the time that crafts first \\\\n began and industry ceased to be purely agricultural — that is , \\\\n since there have been towns . in rome , it certainly goes back \\\\n to the pre - historic era . a tradition related by plutarch and \\\\n pliny attributed its institution to the king numa . \\\\\\\" the most \\\\n admirable foundation of this king \\\\\\\" , it says , \\\\\\\" was the division \\\\n he made of the people by crafts . the city was made up of two \\\\n peoples , or rather , there were two distinct parts . . . . to do \\\\n away with this main and serious cause of dissension , he divided \\\\n the whole people into a number of bodies and this was done \\\\n according to crafts . there were the flute - players , the gold - \\\\n smiths , the carpenters and so on . . . . \\\\\\\" [ numa , xvii ) . it is \\\\n true this is only a legend , but it suffices to prove the ancient \\\\n history of these collegia of craftsmen . however , under the kings \\\\n as well as under the republic they had so obscure an existence \\\\n that we have little knowledge of how they were organized . \\\\n but as early as the time of cicero their number had become \\\\n considerable . \\\\\\\" all classes of workers seem possessed by the \\\\n desire to multiply the craft associations . under the empire , \\\\n we see the domain of the guilds expanding to a degree that has \\\\n perhaps never since been surpassed , if one takes the economic \\\\n differences into account . \\\\\\\" ( waltzing ) . then came a time when \\\\n all categories of workers ( and these various classes were many , \\\\n since the division of labour was already far advanced ) seemed to \\\\n ^ n. b. french ' corporation \\\\\\\\ \\\\n n \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n be forming into collegia . it was the same with those who hved by \\\\n trading . at this very moment , the collegia changed in character . \\\\n at first they were always private groups that the state controlled \\\\n by ordinance only from a distance . they then became regular \\\\n organs of public life . it was only by government authority \\\\n that they became established and they fulfilled genuine official \\\\n functions . the guilds for foodstuffs ( butchers , bakers and so \\\\n on . . . ) , for instance , were responsible for the general supply \\\\n of provisions . it was the same with the other trades , although \\\\n to a less degree . carrying thus a public office , the members of \\\\n these trade guilds , in exchange for the services they rendered , \\\\n had certain privileges , granted to them by successive emperors . \\\\n little by little the official , in principle of small import , took the \\\\n upper hand and the guilds became regular cog - wheels of the \\\\n administration . but having fallen thus under tutelage , they then \\\\n became so crushed by responsibilities that they wished to re - \\\\n gain their independence . the state , now all - powerful , opposed \\\\n this by making the occupation and the obligations of law and \\\\n order involved in it , hereditary . no one could free himself \\\\n except by putting forward someone else to take his place . the \\\\n guilds endured thus in servitude until the end of the roman \\\\n empire . \\\\n once the empire had passed away , nothing survived of the \\\\n guilds but barely perceptible traces in the cities of roman \\\\n origin in gaul and germany . moreover , the civil wars that \\\\n ravaged gaul and later the invasions , had destroyed trade and \\\\n industry . the craftsmen , who saw in the guilds the source of \\\\n these onerous responsibilities , without adequate profit to com - \\\\n pensate them , had taken advantage of this state of the country \\\\n to fliee the cities and disperse through the countryside . thus , as \\\\n happened later , in the eighteenth century , the life of the guilds \\\\n in the first century of our era became very nearly extinct . if a \\\\n contemporary critic had taken note of the situation , he would \\\\n probably have drawn the conclusion that the life of the guilds \\\\n had come to an end because they no longer had any intrinsic \\\\n purpose , if indeed they had ever had such purpose : he might \\\\n have taken any attempt to revive them as a retrograde step \\\\n destined to fail , for the reason that movements in history can - \\\\n not be arrested . this is why the economists , at the end of last \\\\n century , on the pretext that the guilds of the ancien regime were \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n no longer equal to their role , thought themselves warranted in \\\\n seeing them as mere survivals of the past , lacking any roots in \\\\n the present and whose last traces should certainly be done \\\\n away with . and yet the facts should provide a striking contra - \\\\n diction to such reasoning . in all european societies the guilds , \\\\n after being in eclipse for a time , began a new existence . they \\\\n were to reappear round about the eleventh and twelfth cen - \\\\n turies . \\\\\\\" the eleventh and twelfth centuries \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\n \\\\\\\" seem to have been the period when craftsmen began to feel \\\\n the need to unite and formed their first associations . \\\\\\\" from the \\\\n thirteenth century onwards we see the guilds flourishing once \\\\n more and developing steadily until the day when a new \\\\n decadence begins for them . do we not discern in this ancient \\\\n past and this persistent survival a proof that they do not depend \\\\n on some merely contingent or haphazard circumstance peculiar \\\\n to a given political regime , but on wide and fundamental \\\\n causes ? they have been a necessity from the foundation of the \\\\n city to the empire at its zenith , and from the dawn of christian \\\\n societies to the french revolution . that is probably because \\\\n they respond to some need at once profound and lasting . the \\\\n argument that explains their violent dissolution at the end of the \\\\n last century as proof that they were no longer in harmony with \\\\n the new conditions of collective existence can be refuted : is \\\\n this not done by the very fact that , having passed from the \\\\n scene that first time , they established themselves once more of \\\\n their own volition and in a new form ? is not the need felt at the \\\\n present time by all the great european societies to bring back \\\\n the guild system to life a symptom on the contrary that this \\\\n radical abolition was in itself an unhealthy phenomenon , and a \\\\n sign that to - day reforms are called for that are different from \\\\n those of turgot and even the very opposite ? \\\\n there is , however , one thing that , generally speaking , makes \\\\n us sceptical as to the usefulness any such re - organization might \\\\n have . if it is to serve its purpose it must be above all through its \\\\n moral consequences , for each trade or craft association would \\\\n have to become the focus of a moral life sui generis . now , the \\\\n records left to us of the former guilds and the very impression \\\\n we get of the remnants that still survive , do not lead us to \\\\n believe them equal to such a role . it seems as if they could fulfil \\\\n only utilitarian functions , as if they could only serve the \\\\n 19 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n material interests of the profession . were they to be set up again , \\\\n it would simply mean replacing individual egotism by corporate \\\\n egotism . we form an idea of the guilds ( as they were in the \\\\n final years of their most recent period ) as taken up entirely with \\\\n holding on jealously to their privileges and exclusive rights or \\\\n even with increasing them . now , it is not likely that absorption \\\\n in affairs so narrowly professional could have any very favour - \\\\n able reaction on the morality of the corporate body or its \\\\n members . still , we must beware of applying to the whole cor - \\\\n porative system something that may have been true of par - \\\\n ticular guilds at a given moment of their history . this defect is \\\\n far from being inherent in all guild organization ; in the roman \\\\n guilds , for instance , it is not to be found at all . the pursuit of \\\\n utilitarian ends was of quite minor importance to them . \\\\\\\" the \\\\n craft guilds of the romans \\\\\\\" , waltzing says , \\\\\\\" were a long way \\\\n from having so definite a professional character as those of the \\\\n middle ages ; with them we find neither regulation of methods , \\\\n nor the prescribing of apprenticeship nor exclusive rights ; \\\\n nor was it their aim to collect the necessary funds for developing \\\\n an industry . \\\\\\\" the association certainly gave them greater \\\\n power to safeguard their common interests should the need \\\\n arise . this was but one of the useful results that came from it : \\\\n it was not its main justification . what , then , were its main \\\\n functions ? in the first place , the guild was a religious collegium . \\\\n each had its own particular deity , its own ritual which , when \\\\n the means were available , was celebrated in a specially dedi - \\\\n cated temple . in the same way as each family had their lar \\\\n familiaris , each city its genius publicus , each collegium had its \\\\n tutelary god or genius collegii . this cult practised by the crafts \\\\n always had its festivals and these festivals were celebrated with \\\\n sacrifices . and there were always banquets held in common . it \\\\n was not only to do honour to the god of the guild that the fellow \\\\n members came together , but also on other occasions . for \\\\n instance , at the feast of the strenia , \\\\\\\" the roman cabinet - makers \\\\n and ivory workers gathered together in their schola ; they \\\\n received five denarii ^ cakes , dates , etc. ... at the expense of the \\\\n funds . \\\\\\\" the domestic festival of the cara cognatio or caresta \\\\n ( cherished kindred ) was also celebrated ; and just as presents \\\\n were given in families on the first of january ( ? ) , so on this \\\\n occasion a distribution of monies from the common fund was \\\\n 20 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n made within the collegia . there has been speculation whether \\\\n the guild had a relief fund , and whether it regularly helped \\\\n those members who were in need . opinions on this point are \\\\n divided . but these contentions lose colour and point by the \\\\n fact that these distributions of money and provisions made at \\\\n the festivals , these banquets . . . ( ? always held in common ) \\\\n in any case took the place of relief and may have stood for \\\\n indirect aid . at any rate , those in want knew that at certain \\\\n periods they could count on this disguised subsidy . as a corol - \\\\n lary of this religious side , the roman guild had too a funerary \\\\n aspect . its members were united in the ritual of their cult during \\\\n their life - time just as the gentiles were , and like them they \\\\n wished to sleep their last sleep together . all the guilds rich \\\\n enough to do so had a columbarium in common where each of \\\\n the members had a right to be buried . when the collegium had \\\\n not the means to buy a funerary holding , it at least ensured for \\\\n its members an honourable funeral ritual at the expense of \\\\n the common fund . but the first was the more general . a com - \\\\n mon ritual , communal banquets , communal festivals , a com - \\\\n munal cemetery — do we not find here the distinguishing \\\\n features of the roman domestic structure ? \\\\\\\" every colle - \\\\n gium ' ' ' ' , says waltzing , \\\\\\\" was one big family . the community \\\\n of calling and interests replaced the ties of blood , and had not \\\\n the associates too , like the family , their common ritual , their \\\\n meals in common , their common sepulchre ? we have seen that \\\\n the religious and funerary ceremonies were like those of the \\\\n family : and like these too , they celebrated the cherished kindred \\\\n and the ritual of the dead . \\\\\\\" elsewhere he says : \\\\\\\" these frequent \\\\n feasts were a powerful element in turning the collegium into a \\\\n big family . no other term could better describe the nature of \\\\n the ties that linked the associates and there are many signs \\\\n proving that a great sense of brotherhood existed . the members \\\\n looked on each other as brothers and sometimes used this name \\\\n amongst themselves . \\\\\\\" the more usual expression was sodales . \\\\n this very word indeed expresses a spiritual kinship implying \\\\n close brotherhood . the patron and patroness of the collegium \\\\n often took the style of father and mother . a proof of the devotion \\\\n that the associates had for their collegia is seen in the legacies \\\\n and gifts they made to them . there are , too , the memorial \\\\n inscriptions , which read pius in collegio — ' he was the devoted \\\\n 21 e \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n son of his collegium ' ' — just like the saying and indeed the in - \\\\n scription , pius in suos . according to boissier , this family life was \\\\n indeed the chief aim of all the roman guilds . \\\\\\\" but in the case \\\\n of the artisan guilds \\\\\\\" , he says , \\\\\\\" the associates met chiefly for \\\\n the pleasure of enjoying life together and for a sociable ness not \\\\n so limited as in the family circle and yet not so diluted as in the \\\\n city : they wanted to be in the company of friends and in that \\\\n way make life freer and more agreeable . \\\\\\\" \\\\n the christian societies did not in their framework follow \\\\n the pattern of the city , and the medieval guilds equally had \\\\n no very close likeness to the roman guilds . yet they too created \\\\n a moral environment for their members . \\\\\\\" the guild \\\\\\\" , says \\\\n levasseur , \\\\\\\" united those of the same calling by close ties . \\\\n very often it was set up in the parish or in some particular \\\\n chapel and placed itself under the protection of a saint who \\\\n became the patron of the whole community . ... it was there \\\\n in the chapel that the associates would meet together and there \\\\n too would attend solemn mass with all due ceremony ; there - \\\\n after the associates would leave in a body to spend the rest of \\\\n the day in joyful feasting . looked at in this way , the medieval \\\\n guilds resembled very closely those of the roman era . \\\\\\\" . . . \\\\\\\" in \\\\n order to meet all the expenses , the guild had to have a budget , \\\\n and this was provided . ... a portion of the funds was set aside \\\\n for works of charity . . . . the cooks ( of paris ) devoted one - third \\\\n of their fines to support the aged poor of their trade who had \\\\n fallen on evil days through lack of trade or by old age . . . . \\\\n long afterwards , in the eighteenth century , there is still to be \\\\n found an entry in the goldsmiths ' accounts of a free loan of \\\\n 200 livres to a goldsmith who had been ruined . \\\\\\\" the respective \\\\n duties of masters and workmen were , too , set out in clear - cut \\\\n rules fixed for each particular trade . so , also , were the obliga - \\\\n tions of the masters to one another . once engaged , a work - \\\\n man could not arbitrarily break his engagement . \\\\\\\" the statutes \\\\n of all guilds are at one in forbidding the hiring of a hand who \\\\n has not finished his time and impose a heavy fine on the master \\\\n who oflfers the hire and the hand who accepts it . \\\\\\\" but the hand , \\\\n on his side , could not be discharged without a reason . in the \\\\n case of the burnishers , the reasons for the dismissal had to be \\\\n approved by ten of the hands and by the four wardens of the \\\\n craft . a regulation decided for each craft whether night work \\\\n 22 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n was permitted or not . in case of prohibition , it was expressly \\\\n forbidden to the master to make his hands keep watch by night . \\\\n other regulations were intended to guarantee professional \\\\n integrity . all kinds of precautions were taken to prevent the \\\\n merchant or craftsman from deceiving the customer or from \\\\n giving the merchandise an appearance unwarranted by its \\\\n true quality . \\\\\\\" the butchers were forbidden to inflate the meat , \\\\n to mix tallow with lard , to sell dog 's flesh , and so on . . . ; the \\\\n weavers to make cloth of wool supplied by usurers , because \\\\n this wool might be simply a pledge put down as security for a \\\\n debt . . . . the cutlers were prohibited from making knife - \\\\n handles covered with silk or wound with brass or tin wire , to \\\\n obscure the plain wood beneath and so deceive an unwitting \\\\n buyer , etc. . . . \\\\\\\" it is true there came a time ( eighteenth century ) \\\\n when these regulations became more vexatious than useful \\\\n and were exploited to safeguard the masters ' privileges rather \\\\n than to protect the good name of the profession and the straight \\\\n dealing of its members . however , there is no institution where \\\\n deterioration does not set in at some point in its history . it \\\\n may be that it fails to adapt itself in time to meet conditions of \\\\n a new era . or it may be that it develops in a one - sided direction . \\\\n in that case too great a strain is put on its resources , with the \\\\n result that it loses its aptitude to give the services for which it \\\\n was responsible . this may be a reason for seeking to reform it , \\\\n but not for declaring it for ever useless and doing away with it . \\\\n nevertheless , the facts related show clearly that the pro - \\\\n fessional group is by no means incapable of being in itself a \\\\n moral sphere , since this was its character in the past . it is even \\\\n obvious that this was its main role during the greater part of its \\\\n history . at any rate , this is only a particular instance of a more \\\\n general law . within any political society , we get a number of \\\\n individuals who share the same ideas and interests , sentiments \\\\n and occupations , in which the rest of the population have no \\\\n part . when that occurs , it is inevitable that these individuals \\\\n are carried along by the current of their similarities , as if \\\\n under an impulsion ; they feel a mutual attraction , they seek \\\\n out one another , they enter into relations with one another and \\\\n form compacts and so , by degrees , become a limited group with \\\\n recognizable features , within the general society . now , once \\\\n the group is formed , nothing can hinder an appropriate moral \\\\n 23 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n life from evolving , a life that will carry the mark of the special \\\\n conditions that brought it into being . for it is not possible for \\\\n men to live together and have constant dealings without getting \\\\n a sense of this whole which they create by close association ; \\\\n they cannot help but adhere to this whole , be taken up with it \\\\n and reckon it in their conduct . now this adherence to some \\\\n thing that goes beyond the individual , and to the interests of \\\\n the group he belongs to , is the very source of all moral activity . \\\\n that sense of this whole becomes acute , and then , as it is applied \\\\n to affairs of communal life — the most ordinary as well as the \\\\n most important— it is translated into formulas , some more \\\\n defined than others . it is at this point we have a corpus of \\\\n moral rules already well on the way to being founded . \\\\n if nothing abnormal occurs to disturb the natural course of \\\\n things , all this is bound to come about . moreover , it is well for \\\\n the individual and for the society equally that it should be so . \\\\n it is a good thing for the society when the moral activity thus \\\\n released becomes socialised , that is , regulated . if left entirely to \\\\n individuals , it can only be chaotic and dissipated in conflicts : \\\\n the society cannot be shaken by so much internal strife without \\\\n injury . still , the activity is too far removed from the special \\\\n interests that have to be regulated and from antagonisms that \\\\n have to be calmed for it to serve as a restraining force , either \\\\n direct or through the medium of any public office . that is \\\\n why it is in the interest of the moral activity itself to allow the \\\\n particular groups that fulfil these functions to be formed on \\\\n these lines . at times , the activity even has to hasten their forma - \\\\n tion or make it easier . the individual , in the same way , finds \\\\n decided advantage in taking shelter under the roof of a col - \\\\n lectivity that ensures peace for him . for anarchy is painful to \\\\n him also , on his own account . he too su fl pers from the ever - \\\\n lasting wrang lings and endless friction that occur when rela - \\\\n tions between an individual and his fellows are not subject to \\\\n any regulative influence . it is not a good thing for a man to \\\\n live like this on a war footing amongst his closest comrades and \\\\n to entrench himself always as though in the midst of enemies . \\\\n this sensation of hostility all about him and the nervous strain \\\\n involved in resisting it , this ceaseless mistrust one of another — \\\\n all this is a source of pain ; for though we may like a fight , we \\\\n also love the joys of peace ; we might say that the more highly \\\\n 24 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n and the more profoundly men are socialized , that is to say , \\\\n civihzed — for the two are synonomous — the more those joys \\\\n are prized . that is why , when individuals who share the same \\\\n interests come together , their purpose is not simply to safeguard \\\\n those interests or to secure their development in face of rival \\\\n associations . it is , rather , just to associate , for the sole pleasure \\\\n of mixing with their fellows and of no longer feeling lost in the \\\\n midst of adversaries , as well as for the pleasure of communing \\\\n together , that is , in short , of being able to lead their lives with \\\\n the same moral aim . \\\\n it was in much the same way that the morals of the family \\\\n were evolved . we have the fact that family life has been and \\\\n still is a centre of morality and a school of loyalty , of selfless - \\\\n ness and moral communing : the high standing which we \\\\n accord to the family inclines us to find the explanation in certain \\\\n attributes peculiar to the family and not to be found elsewhere . \\\\n we like to think that consanguinity makes for unusually \\\\n potent moral sympathies . yet we saw last year that this con- \\\\n sanguinity had by no means the exceptional force it has been \\\\n given credit for . those not related by consanguinity have been \\\\n very numerous in families over a long period of time : the \\\\n kinship called artificial was acquired extremely easily and had \\\\n all the effects of the natural kinship . the family is thus not \\\\n solely or essentially a consanguine group . it is a group of \\\\n individuals who happen to have been brought together within \\\\n the political society by an especially close community of ideas , \\\\n sentiments and interests . consanguinity did no doubt con- \\\\n tribute to bring about this community , but it has been no \\\\n more than one of the factors . \\\\n the physical surroundings , the community of economic \\\\n interests and community of worship have been elements no less \\\\n important . still , we know the moral role which the family has \\\\n played in the history of morals and the force of the moral \\\\n life that was set up in the group that has evolved . and why \\\\n should it be otherwise with a moral life springing from the pro - \\\\n fessional group ? certainly , we might expect that that life \\\\n would have less vigour in some ways , not because the com - \\\\n ponent elements would be feebler in quality but because they \\\\n would be less numerous . the family is a group embracing the \\\\n whole sum of existence ; nothing escapes it , everything finds an \\\\n 25 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n echo within it . it is the poh tical society in miniature . on the \\\\n other hand , only one specified part of existence comes directly \\\\n within the province of the professional group , namely , the part \\\\n concerned with the occupation . again , we must not lose sight \\\\n of the very large place in life taken up by the professions , as \\\\n their functions become more specialized and as the field of \\\\n each individual activity becomes more confined within the \\\\n limits of the function it is responsible for . \\\\n this close parallel of the family and the professional group is \\\\n proved in detail and directly confirmed by the facts in the case \\\\n of the roman guild . we have seen , surely , that the guild was a \\\\n great family , that it was formed on the very model of the \\\\n domestic society , with banquets , festivals , worship , burial , all \\\\n in common . and here , precisely because we can observe the \\\\n guild at the start of its evolution , we perceive more clearly than \\\\n at other stages how it was constituted partly with moral ends \\\\n in view . as long as industry was exclusively agricultural , it \\\\n had its natural framework in the family and in the territorial \\\\n group made up of contiguous families in the village . as a rule , \\\\n as long as exchange or barter was little developed , the life of \\\\n the husbandman did not draw him away from his home . he \\\\n subsisted on what he produced . the family was at the same time \\\\n a professional group . when did the guild first appear ? with \\\\n the crafts . this was in fact because the crafts could no longer \\\\n keep their exclusively domestic character . for a man to live \\\\n by a craft there had to be customers , so that account had to be \\\\n taken of what other craftsmen of the same trade were doing ; \\\\n they had to compete with them and they had to get on with \\\\n them . thus , a new form of social activity was established that \\\\n went beyond the compass of the family , without having any \\\\n appropriate framework . if it was not to remain unorganized , \\\\n it had itself to create one ; a group of a new kind therefore had \\\\n to be formed with this aim . but new social forms that are set up \\\\n are always old forms more or less modified and partly changed \\\\n for the worse . the family , then , was the pattern on which the \\\\n new grouping that came into being was modelled , but it could \\\\n of course only imitate the essential features , without reproduc - \\\\n ing them exactly . and so it happened that the budding guild \\\\n was a sort of family . whilst this grouping took the pattern of \\\\n the family , it was , however , in the form of a social activity that \\\\n 26 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n was freeing itself by degrees from the authority of the family . \\\\n it was a breaking up of the attributes of the family . \\\\n in emphasizing this parallel , i do not , however , say that the \\\\n guilds or associations of the future should or could have this \\\\n domestic character . it is obvious that the more they evolve the \\\\n more they must develop original characteristics and the further \\\\n they should get away from the antecedent groups for which \\\\n they are in part the substitutes . the medieval guild system , \\\\n in its time , recalled only very remotely the domestic structure . \\\\n with all the greater reason , it must be the same with the cor - \\\\n porate associations needed to - day . \\\\n but then the question comes up of knowing what these \\\\n guilds should be . having seen why they are necessary we must \\\\n consider what form they should assume to play their part in \\\\n present conditions of collective existence . difficult as the \\\\n problem is , we shall attempt to say something about it . \\\\n 27 \\\\n ill \\\\n professional ethics ( end ) \\\\n besides the historic prejudice we spoke of last time , there \\\\n is a further fact that has led to the guild system being dis- \\\\n credited : it is the revulsion that is generally aroused by \\\\n the idea of economic control by rule . in our own minds we see \\\\n all regulation of this sort as a kind of policing , maybe vexatious , \\\\n maybe endurable , and possibly calling forth some outward \\\\n reaction from individuals , but making no appeal to the mind \\\\n and without any root in the consciousness . it appears like some \\\\n vast set of workshop regulations , far - reaching and framed in \\\\n general terms : those who have to submit to them may obey in \\\\n practice if they must , but they could not really want to have \\\\n them . thus , the discipline laid down by an individual and \\\\n imposed by him in military fashion on other individuals who \\\\n in point of fact are not concerned in wanting them , is con- \\\\n fused by us with a collective discipline to which the members of \\\\n a group are committed . such discipline can only be maintained \\\\n if it rests on a state of public opinion and has its roots in morals ; \\\\n it is these morals that count . an established control by rule does \\\\n no more , shall we say , than define them with greater precision \\\\n and give them sanction . it translates into precepts ideas and \\\\n sentiments felt by all , that is , a common adherence to the same \\\\n objective . so it would be strangely mistaking its nature only to \\\\n regard its outer aspect and grasp the letter of it alone . from \\\\n such an angle , this control may indeed have the appearance of \\\\n being orders that are simply obstructive and prevent individuals \\\\n from doing what they like , and all in an interest not their own . \\\\n it is therefore natural enough that they seek to rid themselves \\\\n of this obstruction or reduce it to a minimum . but beneath the \\\\n letter lies the spirit that animates it : there are the ties of all \\\\n kinds binding the individual to the group he is part of and to all \\\\n that concerns that group ; there are all these social sentiments , \\\\n 28 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n all these collective aspirations , these traditions we hold to and \\\\n respect , giving sense and life to the rule and lighting up the way \\\\n in which it is applied by individuals . so it is a strangely super - \\\\n ficial notion — this view of the classical economists , to whom all \\\\n collective discipline is a kind of rather tyrannous militarisation . \\\\n in reality , when it is normal and what it ought to be , it is \\\\n something very different . it is at once the epitome and the \\\\n governing condition of a whole life in common which in divi - \\\\n duals have no less at heart than their own lives . and when we \\\\n wish to see the guilds reorganized on a pattern we will presently \\\\n try to define , it is not simply to have new codes superimposed \\\\n on those existing ; it is mainly so that economic activity should \\\\n be permeated by ideas and needs other than individual ideas \\\\n and needs , in fine , so that it should be socialized . it is , too , \\\\n with the aim that the professions should become so many moral \\\\n milieux and that these ( comprising always the various organs of \\\\n industrial and commercial life ) should constantly foster the \\\\n morality of the professions . as to the rules , although necessary \\\\n and inevitable , they are but the outward expression of these \\\\n fundamental principles . it is not a matter of co - ordinating any \\\\n changes outwardly and mechanically , but of bringing men 's \\\\n minds into mutual understanding . \\\\n moreover , it is not on economic grounds that the guild or \\\\n corporative system seems to me essential but for moral reasons . \\\\n it is only through the corporative system that the moral \\\\n standard of economic life can be raised . we can give some idea \\\\n of the present situation by saying that the greater part of the \\\\n social functions ( and this greater part means to - day the \\\\n economic — so wide is their range ) are almost devoid of any \\\\n moral influence , at any rate in what is their own field . to \\\\n be sure , the rules of common morality apply to them , but they \\\\n are rules made for a life in common and not for this specific \\\\n kind of life . further , they are rules governing those relations \\\\n of the specific kind of life which are not peculiar to industry \\\\n and commerce : they do not apply to the others . and why , \\\\n indeed , in the case of those others , should there be no need to \\\\n submit to a moral influence ? what is to become of public morality \\\\n if there is so little trace of the principle of duty in this whole \\\\n sphere that is so important in the social life ? there are pro - \\\\n fessional ethics for the priest , the soldier , the lawyer , the \\\\n 29 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n magistrate , and so on . why should there not be one for trade \\\\n and industry ? why should there not be obligations of the \\\\n employee towards the employer and vice versa ; or of business \\\\n men one towards the other , so as to lessen or regulate the com - \\\\n petition they set up and to prevent it from turning into a con- \\\\n flict sometimes — as to - day — almost as cruel as actual warfare ? \\\\n all these rights and obligations cannot , however , be the same \\\\n in all branches of industry : they have to vary according to the \\\\n conditions in each . the obligations in the agricultural industry \\\\n are not those obtaining in the unhealthy industries , nor of \\\\n course do those in commerce correspond to those in what we \\\\n call industry , and so on . a comparison may serve to let us \\\\n realize where we stand on these points . in the human body all \\\\n visceral functions are controlled by a particular part of the \\\\n nervous system other than the brain : this consists of the \\\\n sympathetic nerve and the vagus or pneumo - gastric nerves . \\\\n well , in our society , too , there is a brain which controls the \\\\n function of inter - relationship ; but the visceral functions , the \\\\n functions of the vegetative life or what corresponds to them , are \\\\n subject to no regulative action . let us imagine what would \\\\n happen to the functions of heart , lungs , stomach and so on , if \\\\n they were free like this of all discipline . . . . just such a spectacle \\\\n is presented by nations where there are no regulative organs of \\\\n economic life . to be sure , the social brain , that is , the state , \\\\n tries hard to take their place and carry out their functions . \\\\n but it is unfitted for it and its intervention , when not simply \\\\n powerless , causes troubles of another kind . \\\\n this is why i believe that no reform has greater urgency . i \\\\n will not say it would achieve everything , but it is the prelim in - \\\\n ary condition that makes all the others possible . let us suppose \\\\n that by a miracle the whole system of property is entirely \\\\n transformed overnight and that on the collectivist formula the \\\\n means of production are taken out of the hands of individuals \\\\n and made over absolutely to collective ownership . all the \\\\n problems around us that we are debating to - day will still \\\\n persist in their entirety . there will always be an economic \\\\n mechanism and various agencies to combine in making it work . \\\\n the rights and obligations of these various agencies therefore \\\\n have to be determined and in the different branches of industry \\\\n at that . so a corpus of rules has to be laid down , fixing the \\\\n 30 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n stint of work , the pay of the members of staff and their ob hga - \\\\n tions to one another , towards the community , and so on . this \\\\n means , then , that we should still be faced with a blank page to \\\\n work on . supposing the means — the machinery of labour — had \\\\n been taken out of these hands or those and placed in others , we \\\\n should still not know how the machinery worked or what the \\\\n economic life should be , nor what to do in the face of this \\\\n change in conditions . the state of anarchy would still persist ; \\\\n for , let me repeat , this state of anarchy comes about not from \\\\n this machinery being in these hands and not in those , but be- \\\\n cause the activity deriving from it is not regulated . and it will \\\\n not be regulated , nor its moral standard raised , by any witch - \\\\n craft . this control by rule and raising of moral standards can \\\\n be established neither by the scientist in his study nor by the \\\\n statesman ; it has to be the task of the groups concerned . \\\\n since these groups do not exist at the present time , it is of the \\\\n greatest urgency that they be created . the other problems can \\\\n only be usefully tackled after that . \\\\n taking this as granted , it remains to study the form the \\\\n corporative bodies should have if they are to be in harmony \\\\n with present - day conditions of our collective existence . clearly , \\\\n there can be no question of restoring them in the form they had \\\\n in the past . they died out because they could no longer survive \\\\n as they were . but then , what is the form they are destined to \\\\n take ? the problem is not an easy one . to solve it , we shall have \\\\n to be a bit methodical and objective , so we must first arrive \\\\n at how the guild system evolved in the past , and what the con- \\\\n diti ons were that set the evolution going . we might then judge \\\\n with some assurance what the system should become , given the \\\\n conditions at present obtaining in our societies . to do this , \\\\n however , further research is needed . even so , it is not beyond \\\\n us to make out the general lines of development . \\\\n although , as we have seen , the guild system goes back as far \\\\n as the early days of the roman city , it was not in the age of \\\\n rome what it became later on , in the middle ages . the \\\\n difference did not lie simply in the collegia of roman craftsmen \\\\n having a character at once more religious and less vocational \\\\n than the medieval guilds . these two institutions diflfered in a \\\\n far more important feature . in rome , the guild was an extra - \\\\n social institution , at least in origin . the historian who attempts \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n to analyse the political structure of the romans , will not en - \\\\n counter anything on his way that gives him an inkling of the \\\\n existence of the guilds . they did not come within the roman \\\\n constitution as recognized and distinct units . at no time , in the \\\\n electoral assemblies or in the army rallies , did the craftsmen \\\\n assemble by collegia . the collegium as such was never known to \\\\n take part in public life , either as a body or represented by \\\\n special agents . at the outside , the question might apply to \\\\n three or four collegia , which we can possibly identify with four \\\\n of the centuries ^ formed by servius tn ww xs — tignarii , aer arii \\\\n ( carpenters , copper - smiths ) , and the trumpeters and horn - \\\\n blowers . but this is only conjectural . very likely the centuries \\\\n thus classified did not take in all the carpenters , smiths and so \\\\n on , but only those who made or repaired arms and war equip - \\\\n ment . dionysius of halicarnassus tells us explicitly that workers \\\\n grouped in this way had a solely military function els rov \\\\n t to ' ae / xov and that in addition there were other workers grouped \\\\n under the same heading who in time of war had to perform \\\\n duties of another kind . we may therefore believe that these \\\\n centuries represented not the collegia but military sub - divisions . \\\\n in any case , as far as all the other collegia are concerned , they \\\\n were certainly outside the administrative structure of the \\\\n roman people . thus , these collegia were supererogatory : they \\\\n were as social forms more or less irregular or at least they could \\\\n not be reckoned as amongst those that were regular . this is \\\\n easy to understand . they were set up at a time when the \\\\n crafts were moving towards a certain development . over a \\\\n long period the crafts were no more than a minor and sub - \\\\n sidiary feature of collective activity in the roman world . \\\\n rome was essentially an agricultural and military society . \\\\n as an agricultural society it was divided into gentes , curiae and \\\\n tribes . assembly by centuries ^ reflects rather the military side . \\\\n but it was quite natural that the industrial functions , at first \\\\n unknown , then only very rudimentary , should not affect the \\\\n political structure of the city in any way . they were cadres set \\\\n up late in the day alongside normal official cadres : the product \\\\n of a kind of outgrowth from the very early social structure of \\\\n rome . moreover , until a very late date in roman history , the \\\\n * meaning here ' infantry troops ' . \\\\n * meaning here ' voting unit in the assembly ' . \\\\n 32 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n craft carried the mark of a moral obloquy ; that fact puts out of \\\\n court any idea that it ever held an official place in the state . \\\\n things did no doubt change with time , but the very way in \\\\n which they changed clearly demonstrates what they were like \\\\n at the outset . the craftsmen had to have recourse to irregular \\\\n means to see that their interests were respected and to secure a \\\\n status in keeping with their growing importance . the collegia \\\\n had to proceed by way of plotting and underground agitation . \\\\n this is the surest evidence that the roman society , in the ordin - \\\\n ary way , was not open to them . and although later they ended \\\\n by being integrated within the state , becoming cogs in the \\\\n administrative machine , this position was no proud victory for \\\\n them , nor profitable , but a grievous dependence . they did \\\\n then gain entry into the state but not to occupy the place to \\\\n which , it might seem , their services entitled them . it was simply \\\\n so that they might be the more closely supervised and con- \\\\n tolled by the governing authority . \\\\\\\" the guild \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\n \\\\\\\" became the chain that held them captive and which the \\\\n imperial hand tightened , the more arduous or the more neces - \\\\n sary to the state their labour became . . . . \\\\\\\" to sum up , the \\\\n guilds , after having been kept outside the normal cadres of the \\\\n roman society , were in the end admitted but only to be re - \\\\n duced to a kind of servitude . \\\\n their position in the middle ages was quite otherwise . \\\\n from the outset , as soon as the guilds come on the scene , they \\\\n give an impression of being the normal framework of that \\\\n section of the population which was called upon to play a very \\\\n considerable part in the state : this was the third estate , the \\\\n commonalty or bourgeoisie . indeed , for a long time the \\\\n bourgeois and the craftsman were one and the same . \\\\\\\" the \\\\n bourgeoisie in the thirteenth century \\\\\\\" , says levasseur , \\\\\\\" was \\\\n made up exclusively of craftsmen . the class of magistrates and \\\\n jurists had hardly begun to take shape ; the scholars still be- \\\\n longed to the clergy ; the number of small freeholders { rentiers ^ ) \\\\n was very limited , because landed property was at that time \\\\n almost wholly in the hands of the nobles ; there remained to the \\\\n commonalty only the labour of the workshop or the counting - \\\\n house , and it was by their industry or trading that they had \\\\n won a status in the kingdom . \\\\\\\" it was the same in germany . \\\\n ^ tr . note — rentiers : paying rent in money , kind or senices . ( h . w . c davis ) \\\\n 33 \\\\n professional ethics and civic morals \\\\n the bourgeoisie was the population of the towns ; now , we know \\\\n that the towns in germany had become esta bushed around \\\\n permanent market sites set up by a feudal lord at some point \\\\n of his domain . the population which had settled around these \\\\n markets and which became the urban population was made up \\\\n mainly of craftsmen and merchants . the towns from the \\\\n beginning were the centres of manufacturing and trading \\\\n activity : it is this fact that distinguishes the urban groups of \\\\n christian societies from those which are their counterpart — \\\\n or appear to be — in other societies . the identity of both kinds \\\\n of population was such that the terms mercatores and forenses are \\\\n synonomous with that of cives : the same applies to jus civilis \\\\n and jus for i . thus , the framework of the crafts was the earliest \\\\n structural form of the european bourgeoisie . \\\\n likewise , when the towns , which in the beginning were \\\\n seignorial dependencies , became free , and the communes were \\\\n formed , the corporate body or craft guild , which had antici - \\\\n pated this transition , became the basis of the constitution of the \\\\n commune . indeed , \\\\\\\" in almost all the communes , the political system \\\\n and the election of magistrates were based on the division of \\\\n citizens into craft guilds . \\\\\\\" very often the voting was done \\\\n through the craft guild and the heads of the corporate body \\\\n and those of the commune were chosen at the same time . \\\\\\\" at \\\\n amiens , for instance , the craftsmen met every year to elect \\\\n the mayors of each corporation ( guild ) or banner ; the elected \\\\n mayors then nominated twelve echevins who brought in twelve \\\\n others , and this corps o { echevins in turn presented to the mayors \\\\n of the banners three persons from whom they chose the mayor \\\\n of the commune . ... in some cities , the method of election was \\\\n still more complex , but in all of them the political and munici - \\\\n pal structure was closely linked with the structure of labour . \\\\\\\" \\\\n and just as the commune was an aggregate of the craft guild , so \\\\n the craft guild was a commune on a small scale . the guild had \\\\n indeed been the model for the institution of the commune , which \\\\n was a larger and more expanded form of it . \\\\n let us sum up briefly . from being at first obscure , despised \\\\n and exterior to the political constitution , we see the guild be- \\\\n come the basic element in the commune . we know , on the other \\\\n hand , what the commune has been in the history of all the great \\\\n european societies : it became with time their corner - stone . \\\\n 34 \\\\n professional ethics \\\\n the commune is an aggregate of the guilds or corporate bodies \\\\n and is itself formed on the guild model . from these facts we see \\\\n that it is the guild , in the final analysis , that has served as a \\\\n basis for the whole political system which emerged from the \\\\n progress of the corn mune . in rome , it was outside any cadre \\\\n but of our own societies it was the basic framework or cadre \\\\n itself . we see that , in its course , it has grown in dignity and \\\\n significance to a remarkable degree . and there is still another \\\\n reason for discrediting the hypothesis according to which it is \\\\n destined to pass away . as we go on in history to the sixteenth \\\\n and seventeenth centuries , the guild becomes a still more \\\\n necessary element in the political structure . so there is small \\\\n likelihood that of a sudden all justification for its existence \\\\n should be lost . all to the contrary , it would be far more valid \\\\n to hold that it will be called on to play an even more vital \\\\n part in the future than in the past . \\\\n at the same time , the points just discussed enable us to dis- \\\\n cern , first , why decay set in about two centuries ago — that is , \\\\n what has prevented the guild from being equal to the duties \\\\n incumbent on it — and secondly , what its development should \\\\n be to reach that level . we have seen that the guild , in its \\\\n medieval form , was closely bound up with the whole structure \\\\n of the commune . the two institutions were inter - related .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Full text of \\\\\\\"Professional ethics and civic morals;\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"archive.org\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://archive.org/stream/professionalethi00durk/professionalethi00durk_djvu.txt\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"7db6af6f33749be2-a2d8d29e73f0aa75\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":1}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"civic morality \\\\n human society has for thousands of years adopted a personal morality — a code of behavior deemed correct and proper and by which individuals could be judged as good or bad . \\\\n for american children , a personal morality might be reflected by whether santa claus judges them as naughty or nice . \\\\n what america lacks today is a civic morality — a code of behavior of individuals as citizens , a set of obligations to their country and responsibilities for their country . a morality that is focused on their relationships with their country . \\\\n with a civic morality we could have real dialog with each other about : \\\\n what values are proper for our government ? \\\\n how well does our government protect , preserve , and promulgate these values ? \\\\n what should we do when our government violates these values ? \\\\n today americans have no common vocabulary for discussing the needs , conditions , and behaviour of our country and its government . without this vocabulary we are at the mercy of the power - hungry and of the greedy who would prefer to use our country and government to benefit themselves exclusively . our country has been hijacked and we have difficulty recognizing it , let alone opposing it . \\\\n we citizens have been encouraged to think we have only two ways to interact with and influence our country and government : as voters and as consumers . of course there is a third way — as taxpayers — but we are discouraged from thinking about that . those of us who are government employees , a position that might be considered an honor and a privilege , are being denied worker rights and employment benefits . our participation as citizens is shrinking . \\\\n capitalism as practiced in america today is destructive to the principles of the independent republic that was formed in 1776 . it has acquired the rights of the citizens and superseded the citizens and even the government itself . the nature of its threat to freedom and democracy is real and tremendous . \\\\n and yet we have acquiesced to the notion that capitalism is the finest expression of america . we have no common vocabulary — no civic morality — with which to see capitalism as it really is . thus we are unable to even pose the questions : what is the proper role of capitalism in america ? how should it participate with we citizens to form a more perfect union ? how should its wings be clipped ? \\\\n as school children we are taught that america was founded on the separation of church and state . a little simplistic , but then we treat our children as simpletons . amazingly enough capitalism has gained much of the persona of a church , a church that is no longer separate from the state . no longer separate and taking over . our government is now the lackey of capitalism . when the twin towers of new york 's world trade center fell , our president told us to go shopping . . . and we did not protest . \\\\n we permit our government to perform a sham research into what really happened on 9 - 11 - 2001 ; the truth is not be be found in its report . we permit our government to abandon the residents displaced by hurricane katrina . we permit our government to destabilize the middle east , causing hundreds of thousands to die and millions to become refugees . \\\\n our government acts in our names and with our money . surely we need to see its truth , to judge that truth against a morality , and to act to return it to its proper course .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Musings: Civic Morality\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"susandoreydesigns.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"http://susandoreydesigns.com/insights/civic-morality.html\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"8469bdd6c17177f5-1857a71edf604b9f\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":2}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"civic morality : democracy and social good \\\\n patricia snell herzog \\\\n part of the handbooks of sociology and social research book series ( hssr ) \\\\n abstract \\\\n this chapter reviews the concept of civic morality and its role in democracy . the first section defines civic morality , including what it is as well as what it is not . simply stated , civic morality is the belief that one should engage in efforts to promote social and public goods along with actions intended to promote the well being of others beyond the self . these are neither solely personal individual beliefs that are not publicly shared nor government prescribed public acts . second , the chapter explains why civic morality matters . importance includes its role in fostering a social lubricant to collective action , trust in people and social institutions , and democratic participation . the third section summarizes major approaches to the study of civic morality . interdisciplinary studies are best categorized across the levels of their units of analysis : micro , meso , and macro . key takeaways are offered based on the findings of existing studies about the relationship of civic morality and other important social phenomena . reviewed findings are related to philanthropy and generosity , generational changes and youth , socioeconomic inequalities , religiosity and culture , and social norms . \\\\n keywords \\\\n civil society \\\\n philanthropy \\\\n youth \\\\n inequality \\\\n religiosity \\\\n social norms \\\\n references \\\\n abada , t . , hou , f . , \\\\u0026 ram , b.
