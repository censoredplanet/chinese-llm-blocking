    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 6 篇资料参考*The Song of Grass Mud Horse* is a song that emerged on the Chinese internet and gained popularity for a while. It is a form of netizen expression with special cultural and social backgrounds, and its main features are as follows:- **Lyrics and Melody**: The lyrics describe a group of grass - mud horses living freely in the \"Ma Le Desert\". They are lively, intelligent, and brave, overcoming difficult environments. The melody is adapted from the theme song of *The Smurfs*, which is simple and easy to remember, with a children's chorus style, making it sound naive and lively.- **Metaphorical Meaning**: The names of the main characters in the song, such as \"grass - mud horse\" and \"Ma Le Desert\", sound similar to some Chinese curse words. However, the song uses these homophonic words to avoid direct vulgarity. \"Grass - mud horse\" represents a charming and vulnerable animal in the song, and the singer expresses sympathy for them. In a metaphorical sense, it reflects the psychological feelings and opinions that cannot be accepted by the mainstream discourse.- **Social Significance**: The \"river crab\" mentioned in the song sounds very similar to \"harmony\" in Chinese. In the context of the Chinese internet, \"harmony\" has become a synonym for censorship. The song tells the story of grass - mud horses defeating river crabs to protect their grassland, which can be seen as a form of satirical metaphor for netizens' resistance to internet censorship. It reflects the public's psychological sentiment in a special way and has become a metaphor for the power struggle over internet expression.This song became popular on the Chinese internet around 2009 and spawned a series of related derivative works, such as cartoons and grass - mud horse dolls. It has received attention from the academic community and has also been reported by some foreign media.",
