shek and the struggle for modern china ( pdf ) ( feb . 03 , 2025 ) \\\\n in 1911 , upon hearing of revolutionary outbreaks in china , chiang returned home and helped in the sporadic fighting that led to the overthrow of the manchus . he then participated in the struggles of china ’s republican and other revolutionaries in 1913 – 16 against china ’s new president and would - be emperor , yuan shikai . \\\\n after these excursions into public life , chiang lapsed into obscurity . for two years ( 1916 – 17 ) he lived in shanghai , where he apparently belonged to the \\\\n green gang ( qing bang ) , a secret society involved in financial manipulations . in 1918 he reentered public life by joining \\\\n sun yat - sen , the leader of the \\\\n nationalist party , or kuomintang . thus began the close association with sun on which chiang was to build his power . sun ’s chief concern was to reunify china , which the downfall of yuan had left divided among warring military satraps . having wrested power from the qing , the revolutionists had lost it to indigenous \\\\n warlords ; unless they could defeat these warlords , they would have struggled for nothing . \\\\n chiang kai - shek chiang kai - shek , c. 1924 . \\\\n shortly after sun yat - sen had begun to reorganize the nationalist party along soviet lines , chiang visited the \\\\n soviet union in 1923 to study soviet institutions , especially the red army . back in china after four months , he became commandant of a military academy , established on the soviet model , at \\\\n whampoa , near guangzhou . soviet advisers poured into guangzhou , and at this time the \\\\n chinese communists were admitted into the nationalist party . the chinese communists quickly gained strength , especially after sun ’s death in 1925 , and tensions developed between them and the more conservative elements among the nationalists . chiang , who , with the whampoa army behind him , was the strongest of sun ’s heirs , met this threat with consummate shrewdness . by alternate shows of force and of leniency , he attempted to stem the communists ’ growing influence without losing soviet support . moscow supported him until 1927 , when , in a bloody coup of his own , he finally broke with the communists , expelling them from the nationalist party and suppressing the labour unions they had organized . \\\\n chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling wedding photograph of chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling , 1927 . \\\\n meanwhile , chiang had gone far toward reunifying the country . commander in chief of the revolutionary army since 1925 , he had launched a massive nationalist campaign against the northern warlords in the following year . this drive ended only in 1928 , when his forces entered beijing , the capital . a new central government under the nationalists , with chiang at its head , was then established at nanjing , farther south . in october 1930 chiang became christian , apparently at the instance of the powerful westernized \\\\n soong family , whose youngest daughter , mei - ling , had become his second wife . as head of the new nationalist government , chiang stood committed to a program of social reform , but most of it remained on paper , partly because his control of the country remained precarious . in the first place , the provincial warlords , whom he had neutralized rather than crushed , still disputed his authority . the communists posed another threat , having withdrawn to rural strongholds and formed their own army and government . in addition , chiang faced certain war with japan , which , after seizing manchuria ( northeast provinces ) in 1931 , showed designs upon china proper . chiang decided not to resist the coming japanese invasion until after he had crushed the communists — a decision that aroused many protests , especially since a complete victory over the communists continued to elude him . to give the nation more moral cohesion , chiang revived the state cult of confucius and in 1934 launched a campaign , the so - called \\\\n new life movement , to inculcate confucian morals . \\\\n chiang kai - shek soldier and statesman chiang kai - shek was head of the nationalist government in china from 1928 to 1949 and subsequently head of the chinese nationalist government in exile in taiwan . he is shown here in 1953 , at the age of 65 . \\\\n chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling , c. 1962 . \\\\n in december 1936 chiang was seized by one of his generals who believed that chinese forces should concentrate on fighting the japanese instead of the communists . chiang was held captive for some two weeks , and the sian ( xian ) incident , as it became known , ended after he agreed to form an alliance with the communists against the japanese invaders . in 1937 the mounting conflict between the two countries erupted into war ( see \\\\n sino - japanese war ) . for more than four years china fought alone until it was joined by the allies , who with the exception of the soviet union declared war on japan in 1941 . china ’s reward was an honoured place among the victors as one of the big four . but internally chiang ’s government showed signs of decay , which multiplied as it resumed the struggle against the communists after the japanese surrendered to the united states in 1945 . civil war recommenced in 1946 ; by 1949 chiang had lost continental china to the communists , and the people ’s republic of china was established . chiang moved to taiwan with the remnants of his nationalist forces , established a relatively benign dictatorship over the island with other nationalist leaders , and attempted to harass the communists across the formosa strait . the chastened chiang reformed the ranks of the once - corrupt nationalist party , and with the help of generous american aid he succeeded in the next two decades in setting taiwan on the road to modern economic development . in 1955 the united states signed an agreement with chiang ’s nationalist government on taiwan guaranteeing its defense . beginning in 1972 , however , the value of this agreement and the future of chiang ’s government were seriously called in question by the growing rapprochement between the united states and the people ’s republic of china . chiang did not live to see the united states finally break diplomatic relations with taiwan in 1979 in order to establish full relations with the people ’s republic of china . after his death in 1975 he was succeeded temporarily by \\\\n yen chia - kan ( c . k . yen ) , who was in 1978 replaced by chiang ’s son chiang ching - kuo . \\\\n chiang kai - shek chiang kai - shek , 1962 . \\\\n among the reasons for chiang ’s overthrow by the communists , one frequently cited is the corruption that he countenanced in his government ; another was his loss of flexibility in dealing with changing conditions . growing more rigid in his leadership over the years , he became less responsive to popular sentiment and to new ideas . he came to prize loyalty more than competence and to rely more on personal ties than on ties of organization . his dependence on a trusted clique also showed in his army , in which he favoured narrow traditionalists over many abler officers . chiang initially maintained his position as republican china ’s paramount leader by shrewdly playing off provincial warlords and possible nationalist rivals against each other and later by his adroit cultivation of american military , diplomatic , and financial support for his regime . his overthrow by the communists can perhaps be traced to his strategy during world war ii ; he generally refused to use his u . s . - equipped armies to actively resist china ’s japanese occupiers and counted instead on the united states to eventually defeat japan on its own . he chose rather to preserve his military machine until the time came to unleash it on the communists at the war ’s end and then crush them once and for all . but by that point chiang ’s strategy had backfired ; his passive stance against the japanese had lost him the prestige and support among the chinese populace that the communists ultimately gained by their fierce anti - japanese resistance . the morale and effectiveness of his armies had decayed during their enforced passivity in southwestern china , while the communists had built up large , battle - hardened armies on the strength of their appeal to chinese nationalist sentiment . finally , it can be said that chiang “ lost china ” because he had no higher vision or coherent plan for making the deep social and economic changes needed to bring chinese society into the 20th century . from his purge of the nationalists ’ communist partners in 1927 and his subsequent alliance with the landowning and mercantile classes , chiang inexorably followed an increasingly conservative path that virtually ignored the plight of china ’s oppressed and impoverished peasantry . the peasants formed almost 90 percent of china ’s population , though , and it was their support , as demonstrated by the communist victory , which proved crucial in once more establishing a strong central government that could achieve the modern unification of china .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Chiang Kai-shek | Biography \\\\u0026 Facts | Britannica\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"britannica.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chiang-Kai-shek\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"6c0b291581ab6c83-49c37a7592cec6ad\\\",\\\"index\\\":1}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"chiang kai - shek \\\\n chiang kai - shek , also romanized as chiang chieh - shih or jiang jieshi and known as chiang chung cheng , was a political and military leader . chiang kai - shek was born in fenghua , chechiang province on october 31 , 1887 . chiang ’s father was a local merchant who died when chiang was eight . having spent a year in a chinese military academy , in 1907 , chiang went to tokyo to attend the japanese army military state college . while in japan , chiang took part in revolutionary activities led by sun yat - sen . \\\\n sun yat - sen and , later , chiang kai - shek formed the nationalist army . in 1924 , when sun set up a military academy near canton in southern china , chiang was appointed commandant of the school . after sun ’s death , chiang assumed leadership of the nationalist party . in 1926 , he launched the northern expedition against warlords , which in two years achieved china ’s unity . this expedition proved to be extremely successful in subduing some of the warlords . however , as the expedition progressed , it developed anti - foreign overtones . in addition , the communist and the kuomintang leftists were converting the expedition into a social and economic revolution and were creating many international enemies through their violent treatment of foreigners . in april of 1927 chiang dispatched his troops to liquidate the communists . this marked the beginning of the enmity between chiang and the communists . \\\\n since chiang 's coup against the communists was not authorized by the central committee of the kuomintang , he was dismissed from his post as commander in chief . however , the leftist members of the kuomintang soon realized that the communists really were agents of moscow . this cleared the way for a reconciliation between the left and right wings of the kuomintang . chiang returned early in 1928 . during this period , chiang consciously decided to stop the revolution short of the masses and to preserve the confucian and traditional order in china . his liquidation of the communists without authority indicated that it was his personal decision . chiang 's refusal to equalize land ownership and to pursue the pro - soviet policy originated by sun supports this idea and appears to be a logical extension of his decision to retain the traditional chinese values . \\\\n in the spring of 1928 chiang continued the northern expedition from the yangtze to peking . peking was taken in june . china was finally reunited , at least in name , in december 1928 when chang hsueh - liang ( the young marshal ) declared his allegiance to the kuomintang . this reunification , however , was more form than fact . chiang , rather than subduing the remaining warlords , created a weak system of alliances . this lack of a firm power base throughout china continually created mutual distrust and resulted in great obstacles to the successful implementation of important reforms and programs . \\\\n after the communists had failed in their attempt to establish a proletarian revolutionary base in wuhan and had withdrawn into their base areas in kiang si province , chiang attempted to complete their destruction . between 1930 and 1933 chiang launched four military operations against the communist base areas . all of these campaigns ended in failure due to superior communist intelligence networks and chiang 's ineptitude . japan inadvertently contributed to the failure of the third and fourth nationalist operations by invading manchuria in 1931 and with the attack on shanghai in 1932 - 1933 . \\\\n chiang 's external problems as leader of the kuomintang regime began when he attempted to exert his influence in the semi - autonomous region of manchuria . this brought him into direct conflict with russia and japan , the two powers who had spheres of influence in the area . the sino - soviet conflict of 1929 was his first confrontation . \\\\n unable to match the japanese on the battlefield , the nationalists signed the tang ku truce in may 1933 and agreed to withdraw from the peking - tientsin area . after signing away part of northern china in the tang ku truce , four years of relative peace with the japanese followed in which chiang again turned his attention on the communists . in 1934 , with the aid of german advisors , chiang devised a military campaign against the communists which was accompanied by an economic blockade that separated and isolated the communists from the people and almost succeeded in destroying them . \\\\n rather than risk total annihilation in a positional battle , the communists broke out of the encirclement and began the \\\\\\\" long march \\\\\\\" from kiang si province to northern shensi province . this six thousand mile march ended in the fall of 1935 with 20,000 of the original 80,000 communists surviving the journey . \\\\n in december of 1936 chiang flew to the headquarters of the manchurian army , at sian , for a first hand look at the situation . on arrival , chiang was kidnapped by the \\\\\\\" young marshal , \\\\\\\" who demanded a united front against japan . chiang refused to negotiate and was released on 25 december , after chou en - lai interceded in chiang 's behalf . \\\\n during the war against the japanese from 1937 to 1945 , chiang was china ’s generalissimo . the japanese eventually gained control of most of the populated areas and economic centers in china and forced chiang to move his government to chungking , deep into the interior of china . even after these defeats chiang refused to surrender and the japanese did not have the manpower to occupy all of china . a deadlock ensued . \\\\n when the united states entered the war against japan , both the communists and nationalists acted as if the war had already been won and began to think in terms of a postwar struggle between themselves . the war with the japanese weakened chiang ’s forces and corruption eroded his government ’s legitimacy . while the nationalists and communists at first cooperated against japan , they soon split . lead by mao tse - tung , the communists proved very effective at gaining the support of china ’s millions of peasants . \\\\n as the u.s. contemplated involvement in world war ii , joseph “ vinegar joe ” stilwell was selected — over his personal objections — to serve as chief of staff to generalissimo chiang kai - shek by president franklin d. roosevelt and his old friend , army chief of staff george c. marshall . in the china - burma - india theater , he commanded and was responsible for the lend - lease supplies going to china and later was assigned as deputy commander of the south east asia command . his primary objective after arrival was to keep the burma road open so that american supplies could continue to flow into china . his efforts proved to be in vain . \\\\n stilwell spoke chinese fluently and had extensive experience in that country . however , his contempt for chiang , whom he called \\\\\\\" peanut , \\\\\\\" was widely known . ' nor was he a fan of president roosevelt , whom he called \\\\\\\" old softy . \\\\\\\" considering himself a professional military man with only soldierly concerns , vinegar joe found the burmese mud preferable to the muck of politics in washington and chungking . \\\\n in a forceful letter to general marshall , fdr wrote : \\\\\\\" stilwell has exactly the wrong approach in dealing with generalissimo chiang .... [ t ] he generalissimo came up the hard way to become the undisputed leader of four hundred million people - an enormously difficult job to attain any kind of unity from a diverse group of all kinds of leaders , ... [ chiang ] finds it necessary to maintain his position of supremacy . you and i would do the same thing under the circumstances . he is the chief executive as well as the commander - in - chief , and one ean not speak sternly to a man like that or exact commitments from him the way we might do from the sultan of morocco . \\\\\\\" \\\\n stilwell immediately ran into difficulties with chiang and one of his own subordinates , claire chennault ( 1890 - 1958 ) , the commander of the american fourteenth air force in china . the difficulty between chiang and stilwell evolved from a complex of internal kuomintang problems that were a direct result of chiang 's previous myopia , preoccupation with the communists , and preservation of confucian tradition . \\\\n the whole tangled structure of chinese politics , culture , and society was reflected in the question of what troops would obey whom under what set of circumstances . loyalty being a conditional virtue in most men , only an observer gifted with clairvoyance could state with accuracy that such and such a division would obey the orders of chungking under all circumstances . thus , the chinese ministry of war would not attempt to order certain yunnanese and szechwanese divisions to leave their native provinces . on another occasion , a very senior general officer of the chinese government bitterly protested giving lend - lease to the troops of a certain war area commander , of unchallenged loyalty to chinese nationalism and the allied cause , at a time when those troops were hotly engaged with the japanese . the war area commander was then out of favor in chungking , and only a very few insiders would have known why . \\\\n china had about 3 , 819 , 000 men under arms . of these , 2 , 919 , 000 were formed into 246 divisions classed by the chinese as \\\\\\\" front - line \\\\\\\" troops . the number of chinese divisions was more than three times as many divisions as the united states had in the field in 1945 . a veritable flood of lend - lease equipment , in hundreds of thousands of tons every year , would have been needed to arm 316 divisions and 47 brigades , after they had been taught how to use and maintain it . a small amount , spread over all these units with a nice eye to face and patronage , would have been spread so thin as to have no effect on the situation . thus , 1 , 080 75 - mm . howitzers would give a modest artillery complement , not far below japanese standards , to thirty divisions . spread evenly over 316 divisions it would amount to about three new pieces for each division , which would leave each unit only nominally less ineffective than before . \\\\n chiang feared , and rightly so , that if the armies of the warlords were as well - trained and equipped as his own , the precarious control he had over them would disappear and the warlords would feel strong enough to exert their own influence and drift away from or challenge kuomintang control . therefore chiang impeded stilwell 's training program and generally restricted it to the forces directly under his control . \\\\n stilwell tried to convince chiang to make the necessary reforms and consolidate his control while the communists were weak and restricted and the kuomintang had the active economic and moral support of the western powers . chiang was not impressed with these arguments and felt that the accumulation of planes and tanks through the lend - lease program would provide the power he needed to handle the communists after the defeat of the japanese . \\\\n chennault constantly complained that he should be allocated more of the tonnage . he insisted that if given sufficient tonnage his air force alone could defeat the japanese without the support of ground forces . this provided chiang with a convenient face - saving alternative to sacrificing his troops in battle with the japanese and allowed him to hoard his men and supplies for the inevitable battle with the communists . the fallacy of this solution was that , as soon as the air power began to hurt the japanese they would take the airfields which were not defendable because of the poorly equipped and deployed chinese ground forces . after a series of disagreements with generalissimo chiang kai - shek and other key officials , stilwell was recalled from his command by president roosevelt . \\\\n the nationalists , occupied at war ’s end with repatriating almost three million japanese and blamed by many for an economy devastated by war , were very unpopular . four years of fighting between communists and nationalists followed the defeat of japan . it appears that the payment for all of chiang 's past sins of commission and omission , stupidity and ineptitude , came due at the same time . \\\\n the poorly trained , ill - led , half - starved and often abused chinese armies that chiang had been boarding deserted en masse . entire divisions switched to the communist side taking their american equipment with them . the whampoa clique complicated matters by discriminating against provincial commanders . the destruction of chiang 's armies on the battlefield was only part of the overall problem . due to protracted corruption and gross mismanagement at high levels , the chinese economy had receded into a state of hyper - inflation . this devastated the chinese middle class and resulted in increased corruption on a wider scale . \\\\n the nationalist effort was dealt a decisive blow by the communists in late 1948 and early 1949 . chiang committed some fifty divisions of his remaining two hundred divisions to form a strong point on the plains around hsu chow . the encircled nationalist troops surrendered on 10 january 1949 . when it was over , the nationalists fled to taiwan , and mao ruled china . \\\\n with the end of world war two taiwan was , at least de facto , restored to the republic of china . chiang kai - shek appointed chen yi , an ally of him , governor of the island . chen yi arrived on october 25 1945 . the military forces of the republic of china under the kuomintang ( chinese nationalist party — chung - kuo kuo - min - tang — usually shorted to kuomintang , kmt ) arrived in taiwan after the war and started to erase all vestiges of japanese rule and to bring the island under nationalist chinese political , economic , and cultural influence . \\\\n rather than treating taiwan as a liberated area , the kmt forces confronted the local population as enemy collaborators . businesses were looted and goods were seized as kmt military officers and politicians took charge . the abolition of the use of widely spoken japanese and the imposition of mandarin chinese led to communications and political problems . taiwanese political groups and the media sought influence , but mainlanders predominated in the key provincial administrative positions . provincial and local assembly elections took place in 1946 , but the taiwanese found their elected bodies had only limited powers . \\\\n anti - mainlander violence flared on february 28 , 1947 , prompted by an incident in which a cigarette seller was injured and a passerby was shot to death by nationalist authorities . the island - wide rioting was brutally put down by nationalist chinese troops , who killed thousands of people . as a result of the february 28 incident , the native taiwanese felt a deep - seated bitterness to the mainlanders . the unrests ended blood ily . regarding the kuomintang ’s own records , at least 28,000 people were killed . \\\\n the korean war proved to be a gift to chiang . on june 27 , 1950 , president harry s. truman , reversing his earlier decision not to become further involved in the chinese civil war , ordered full support to chiang and instructed the u.s. seventh fleet to “ neutralize ” the taiwan strait to prevent possible attacks from the mainland . chiang offered to send his troops to fight in korea , an idea supported by general douglas macarthur . the offer , however , was turned down by the u.s. joint chiefs of staff . at the end of july 1950 , chiang received macarthur in taipei . the two discussed the possibilities of military cooperation , but nothing concrete came of the meeting and no nationalist forces ever fought in korea . \\\\n but fervent anti - communism and the indubitable fact that he was an enemy of the communist chinese gave added legitimacy to his regime and opened the floodgates of u.s. aid . in the decades to follow , chiang ’s regime became progressively less brutal and eventually opened to something close to democracy . in addition , the island republic ’s economy boomed by the 1970 s , until by the 1980 s , its gold reserves actually surpassed those of the united states . \\\\n during the 1950 s , the kmt authorities implemented a far - reaching and highly successful land reform program on taiwan . they redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state - owned industries . although this left some large landowners impoverished , others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises . these entrepreneurs were to become taiwan ’s first industrial capitalists . together with refugee businessmen from the mainland , they managed taiwan ’s transition from an agricultural to a commercial , industrial economy . \\\\n chiang was the president of the republic of china on taiwan until his death april 5 , 1975 . when chiang kei - shek died , he was succeeded by his son , premier chiang ching - kuo ( jiang jing guo ) , as head of the party and president of the republic of china .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Taiwan - Chiang Kai-shek\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"globalsecurity.org\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/taiwan/chiang-kai-shek.htm\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"f5598a85716c0bdd-df1dd2af6541bf62\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":1,\\\"index\\\":2}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"chiang kai -

shek ( october 31 , 1887 – april 5 , 1975 ) was a 20 th - century chinese political and military leader . he is known as jiang jieshi or jiang zhongzheng in standard chinese . chiang was an influential member of the kuomintang ( kmt ) , the chinese nationalist party , and was a close ally of sun yat - sen . he became the commandant of the kuomintang 's whampoa military academy and took sun 's place as leader of the kmt when sun died in 1925 . in 1926 , chiang led the northern expedition to unify the country , becoming china 's nominal leader . [ 3 ] he served as chairman of the national military council of the nationalist government of the republic of china ( roc ) from 1928 to 1948 . chiang led china in the second sino - japanese war ( the chinese theater of world war ii ) , consolidating power from the party 's former regional warlords . unlike sun yat - sen , chiang kai - shek was socially conservative , promoting traditional chinese culture in the new life movement and rejecting western democracy and the nationalist democratic socialism that sun embraced in favor of an authoritarian government . \\\\n chiang 's predecessor , sun yat - sen , was well - liked and respected by the communists , but after sun 's death chiang was not able to maintain good relations with the chinese communist party ( ccp ) . a major split between the nationalists and communists occurred in 1927 ; and , under chiang 's leadership , the nationalists fought a nation - wide civil war against the communists . after japan invaded china in 1937 , chiang agreed to a temporary truce with the cpc . despite some early cooperative military successes against japan , by the time that the japanese surrendered in 1945 neither the cpc nor the kmt trusted each other or were actively cooperating . after american - sponsored attempts to negotiate a coalition government failed in 1946 , the chinese civil war resumed . the cpc defeated the nationalists in 1949 . westad says the communists won the civil war because they made fewer military mistakes than chiang kai - shek , and because in his search for a powerful centralized government , chiang antagonized too many interest groups in china . furthermore , his party was weakened in the war against japan . meanwhile the communists told different groups , such as peasants , exactly what they wanted to hear , and cloaked themselves in the cover of chinese nationalism . [ 4 ] chiang 's government and army retreated to taiwan , where chiang imposed martial law and persecuted people critical of his rule in a period known as the \\\\\\\" white terror \\\\\\\" . after evacuating to taiwan , chiang 's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland china . chiang ruled the island securely as president of the republic of china and general of the kuomintang until his death in 1975 . he ruled mainland china for 22 years , and taiwan for 30 years . \\\\n contents \\\\n 1 early life \\\\n 1.1 childhood \\\\n 1.2 in japan : 1905 – 1911 \\\\n 1.3 return to china \\\\n 1.4 establishment of the kuomintang in guangzhou \\\\n 2 succession of sun yat - sen \\\\n 2.1 competition with wang jingwei \\\\n 2.2 rising power \\\\n 3 tutelage of china \\\\n 3.1 carrying out sun yat-sen 's will \\\\n 3.2 challenges and limitations \\\\n 3.3 ideology : nationalism and anti - communism \\\\n 4 wartime leader of china \\\\n 4.1 chinese civil war : 1927 – 1937 \\\\n 4.2 second sino - japanese war : 1937 – 1945 \\\\n 4.3 relationship with the united states \\\\n 4.4 refusal of french indochina \\\\n 5 losing mainland china \\\\n 5.1 treatment and use of japanese soldiers \\\\n 5.2 conditions during the chinese civil war \\\\n 5.3 competition with li zongren \\\\n 5.4 final communist advance \\\\n 6 presidency in taiwan : 1950 – 1975 \\\\n 6.1 preparations to retake the mainland \\\\n 6.2 dictatorships \\\\n 6.3 relationships with foreign governments \\\\n 6.3.1 japan \\\\n 6.3.2 united states \\\\n 7 death \\\\n 8 cult of personality \\\\n 9 philosophy \\\\n 10 contemporary public perception \\\\n 11 names \\\\n 12 wives \\\\n 13 relationships with generals , ethnic minorities , and religions \\\\n 13.1 relationship with muslims \\\\n 13.2 relationship with buddhists and christians \\\\n 14 see also \\\\n 15 notes \\\\n 16 further reading \\\\n 17 external links \\\\n early life \\\\n childhood \\\\n chiang kai - shek in 1907 at the baoding military academy \\\\n chiang was born in x ikou , a town approximately 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) southwest of downtown ningbo , in fenghua , zhejiang . however , his ancestral home , a concept important in chinese society , was the town of he qiao ( 和 橋 鎮 ) in yixing , jiangsu , approximately 38 km ( 24 mi ) southwest of downtown wuxi , and 10 km ( 6 . 2 mi ) from the shores of lake tai . chiang 's father , jiang zhao cong ( 蔣 肇 聰 ) , and mother , wang caiyu ( 王采玉 ) , were members of an upper - middle to upper - class family of salt merchants . chiang 's father died when he was only eight years of age , and he wrote of his mother as the \\\\\\\" embodiment of confucian virtues \\\\\\\" . \\\\n in japan : 1905 – 1911 \\\\n chiang grew up in a time period in which military defeats and civil wars among warlords had left china destabilized and in debt , and he decided to pursue a military career . he began his military education at the baoding military academy , in 1906 . he then left for the tokyo shinbu gakko ( 東京 振武 學校 ) , an imperial japanese army academy preparatory school for chinese students , in 1907 . there he was influenced by his compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the qing dynasty and to set up a chinese republic . he befriended fellow zhejiang native chen qimei , and , in 1908 , chen brought chiang into the tong menghui , a precursor of the kuomintang ( kmt ) organization . chiang served in the imperial japanese army from 1909 to 1911 . \\\\n return to china \\\\n returning to china in 1911 after learning of the outbreak of the wuchang uprising , chiang intended to fight as an artillery officer . he served in the revolutionary forces , leading a regiment in shanghai under his friend and mentor , chen qimei , as one of chen 's chief lieutenants . in early 1912 , a dispute arose between chen and a dissident member of the revolutionary alliance who opposed both sun yat - sen and chen , and who sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital . when chiang located him , chen dispatched assassins , and although he probably did not take part himself , chiang later assumed responsibility in order not to get chen in trouble . chen valued chiang in spite of his now legendary quick temper , thinking that such bellicosity was useful in a military leader . [ 5 ] \\\\n after the success of the 1911 revolution , chiang became a founding member of the kmt . after the takeover of the republican government by yuan shikai and the failed second revolution in 1913 , chiang , like his kmt comrades , divided time between exile in japan and the havens of the shanghai international settlement . in shanghai , chiang cultivated ties with the city 's underworld gangs , dominated by the notorious green gang and its leader du yuesheng . on may 18 , 1916 agents of yuan shikai assassinated chen qimei . chiang then succeeded chen as leader of the chinese revolutionary party in shanghai . sun yat-sen 's career was at its lowest point then , with most of his old revolutionary alliance comrades refusing to join him in the exiled chinese revolutionary party . [ 6 ] \\\\n establishment of the kuomintang in guangzhou \\\\n in 1917 , sun yat - sen moved his base of operations to guangzhou , and chiang joined him in 1918 . at this time sun remained largely sidelined ; and , without arms or money , was soon expelled from guangzhou and exiled again to shanghai . he was restored to guangzhou with mercenary help in 1920 . after returning to guangzhou , a rift developed between sun , who sought to militarily unify china under the kmt , and guangdong governor chen jiong ming , who wanted to implement a federalist system with guangdong as a model province . on june 16 , 1923 chen attempted to assassinate sun and had his residence shelled . during a prolonged skirmish between the troops of these opposing forces , sun and his wife soong ching - ling narrowly evaded heavy machine gun fire and were rescued by gunboats under chiang 's direction . the incident earned chiang the trust of sun yat - sen . \\\\n sun regained control of guangzhou in early 1924 , again with the help of mercenaries from yunnan , and accepted aid from the comintern . undertaking a reform of the kmt , he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying china under the kmt . that same year , sun sent chiang to spend three months in moscow studying the soviet political and military system . during his trip in russia , chiang met leon trotsky and other soviet leaders , but quickly came to the conclusion that the russian model of government was not suitable for china . chiang later sent his eldest son , ching - kuo , to study in russia . after his father 's split from the first united front in 1927 , ching - kuo was forced to stay there , as a hostage , until 1937 . chiang wrote in his diary , \\\\\\\" it is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son . \\\\\\\" [ 7 ] [ 8 ] chiang even refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for the chinese communist party leader . [ 9 ] his attitude remained consistent , and he continued to maintain , by 1937 , that \\\\\\\" i would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation 's interests . \\\\\\\" chiang had absolutely no intention of ceasing the war against the communists . [ 10 ] \\\\n chiang kai - shek returned to guangzhou and in 1924 was appointed commandant of the whampoa military academy by sun . chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with sun 's extremely close cooperation with the comintern , but returned at sun 's demand . the early years at whampoa allowed chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the kmt and himself . \\\\n throughout his rise to power , chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist tiandi hui fraternity , to which sun yat - sen also belonged , and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the kuomintang . \\\\n succession of sun yat - sen \\\\n competition with wang jingwei \\\\n sun yat - sen died on march 12 , 1925 , [ 11 ] creating a power vacuum in the kuomintang . a contest ensued between chiang , who stood at the right wing of the kmt , and sun yat-sen 's close comrade - in - arms wang jingwei , who leaned towards the left . although wang succeeded sun as chairman of the national government , chiang 's relatively low position in the party 's internal hierarchy was bolstered by his military backing and adept political maneuvering following the zhongshan warship incident . on june 5 , 1926 , chiang became commander - in - chief of the national revolutionary army ( nra ) , [ 12 ] and on july 27 he launched a military campaign known as the northern expedition in order to defeat the warlords controlling northern china and to unify the country under the kmt . \\\\n the nra branched into three divisions : to the west was wang jingwei , who led a column to take wuhan ; bai chongxi 's column went east to take shanghai ; chiang himself led in the middle route , planning to take nanjing before pressing ahead to capture beijing . however , in january 1927 , wang jingwei and his kmt leftist allies took the city of wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare . allied with a number of chinese communists and advised by soviet agent mikhail borodin , wang declared the national government as having moved to wuhan . having taken nanking in march ( and briefly visited shanghai , now under the control of his close ally bai chong xi ) , chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with wang 's leftist elements , which he believed threatened his control of the kmt . \\\\n now with an established national government in nanjing , and supported by conservative allies including hu hanmin , chiang 's expulsion of the communists and their soviet advisers led to the beginning of the chinese civil war . wang jingwei 's national government was weak militarily , and was soon ended by chiang with the support of a local warlord ( li zongren of guangxi ) . eventually , wang and his leftist party surrendered to chiang and joined him in nanjing . in the central plains war , beijing was taken on june , 1928 , from an alliance of the warlords feng yuxiang and yan xishan . in december , the manchurian warlord zhang xueliang pledged allegiance to chiang 's government , completing chiang 's nominal unification of china and ending the warlord era . \\\\n in 1927 , when he was setting up the nationalist government in nanjing , he was preoccupied with \\\\\\\" the elevation of our leader dr. sun yat - sen to the rank of ' father of our chinese republic ' . dr. sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the nationalist cause , and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position \\\\\\\" . he asked chen guofu to purchase a photograph that had been taken in japan around 1895 or 1898 . it showed members of the revive china society with yeung kui - wan ( 楊 衢 雲 or 杨衢云 , pinyin yáng qúyún ) as president , in the place of honour , and sun , as secretary , on the back row , along with members of the japanese chapter of the revive china society . when told that it was not for sale , chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative . \\\\\\\" the party must have this picture and the negative at any price . they must be destroyed as soon as possible . it would be embarrassing to have our father of the chinese republic shown in a subordinate position \\\\\\\" . [ 13 ] chiang never obtained either the photo or its negative . \\\\n chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of sun yat - sen . in a pairing of great political significance , chiang was sun 's brother - in - law : he had married soong may - ling , the younger sister of soong ching - ling , sun 's widow , on december 1, 1927 . originally rebuffed by her in the early 1920 s , chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with soong may-ling 's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and then promising to eventually convert to christianity . on january 7 , 1929 , the nationalist information bureau stated that chiang was not a christian [ 14 ] after this , he was baptized in the methodist church in 1929 , a year after his marriage to soong . upon reaching beijing , chiang paid homage to sun yat - sen and had his body moved to the new capital of nanjing to be enshrined in a grand mausoleum . \\\\n rising power \\\\n in the west and in the soviet union , chiang kai - shek was known as the \\\\\\\" red general \\\\\\\" . [ 2 ] movie theaters in the soviet union showed newsreels and clips of chiang . at moscow , sun yat - sen university portraits of chiang were hung on the walls ; and , in the soviet may day parades that year , chiang 's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of karl marx , vladimir lenin , joseph stalin , and other socialist leaders . [ 15 ] the united states consulate and other westerners in shanghai were concerned about the approach of \\\\\\\" red general \\\\\\\" chiang as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the northern expedition . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] the western powers backed the zhili clique , and were concerned about either the soviet - backed kuomintang or the japanese - backed fengtian clique seizing control of china . the japanese were also concerned that chiang might defeat the fengtian clique . \\\\n on april 12 , chiang carried out a purge of thousands of suspected communists and dissidents in shanghai , and began large - scale massacres across the country collectively known as the \\\\\\\" white terror \\\\\\\" . throughout april 1927 , more than 12,000 people were killed in shanghai . the killings drove most communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside , where the kmt was less powerful . [ 18 ] in the year after april 1927 , over 300,000 people died across china in anti - communist suppression campaigns executed by the kmt .

[ 22 ] as with his predecessor sun yat - sen , the western media dubbed him \\\\\\\" generalissimo \\\\\\\" . [ 12 ] \\\\n according to sun yat-sen 's plans , the kuomintang ( kmt ) was to rebuild china in three steps : military rule , political tutelage , and constitutional rule . the ultimate goal of the kmt revolution was democracy , which was not considered to be feasible in china 's fragmented state . since the kmt had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928 , chiang 's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be \\\\\\\" political tutelage \\\\\\\" in sun yat-sen 's name . during this so - called republican era , many features of a modern , functional chinese state emerged and developed . \\\\n the decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign imperialism , concessions and privileges in china , moderated through diplomacy . the government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems , attempted to stabilize prices , amortize debts , reform the banking and currency systems , build railroads and highways , improve public health facilities , legislate against traffic in narcotics , and augment industrial and agricultural production . not all of these projects were successfully completed . efforts were made towards improving education standards ; and , in an effort to unify chinese society , the new life movement was launched to encourage confucian moral values and personal discipline . guoyu ( \\\\\\\" nation - language \\\\\\\" ) , was promoted as an standard tongue , and the establishment of communications facilities ( including radio ) were used to encourage a sense of chinese nationalism in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government . \\\\n challenges and limitations \\\\n any successes that the nationalists did make , however , were met with constant political and military upheavals . while much of the urban areas were now under the control of the kmt , much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and communists . chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action , but such action was costly in terms of men and material . the 1930 central plains war alone nearly bankrupted the nationalist government and caused almost 250,000 casualties on both sides . in 1931 , hu hanmin , chiang 's old supporter , publicly voiced a popular concern that chiang 's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the nationalist government . chiang had hu put under house arrest , but he was released after national condemnation after which he left nanjing and supported a rival government in guangzhou . the split resulted in a military conflict between hu 's guangzhou government and chiang 's nationalist government . chiang only won the campaign against hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord zhang xueliang , who had previously supported hu hanmin . \\\\n throughout his rule , complete eradication of the communists remained chiang 's dream . after assembling his forces in jiangxi , chiang led his armies against the newly established chinese soviet republic . with help from foreign military advisers , chiang 's fifth campaign finally surrounded the chinese red army in 1934 . the communists , tipped off that a nationalist offensive was imminent , retreated in the long march , during which mao zedong rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the communist party of china . \\\\n ideology : nationalism and anti - communism \\\\n chiang , as a nationalist and a confucianist , was against the iconoclasm of the may fourth movement . motivated by his sense of nationalism , he viewed some western ideas as foreign , and he believed that the great introduction of western ideas and literature that the may fourth movement promoted was not beneficial to china . he and dr. sun criticized the may fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of china 's youth . [ 23 ] \\\\n contrary to communist propaganda that chiang was pro - capitalism , chiang kai - shek antagonized the capitalists of shanghai , often attacking them and confisticating their capital and assets for the use of the government . chiang confiscated the wealth of capitalists even while he denounced and fought against communists . [ 24 ] chiang crushed pro - communist worker and peasant organizations and rich shanghai capitalists at the same time . chiang continued dr. sun yat-sen 's anti capitalist ideology , directing kuomintang media to openly attack capitalists and capitalism , demanding government controlled industry instead . [ 25 ] \\\\n chiang has often been interpreted as being pro - capitalist , but this conclusion may be problematic . shanghai capitalists did briefly support him out of fear of communism in 1927 , but this support eroded in 1928 when chiang turned his tactics of intimidation on them . the relationship between chiang kai - shek and chinese capitalists remained poor throughout the period of his administration . [ 26 ] chiang blocked chinese capitalists from gaining any political power or voice within his regime . once chiang kai - shek was done with his white terror on pro - communist laborers , he proceeded to turn on the capitalists . gangster connections allowed chiang to attack them in the international settlement , successfully forcing capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions . [ 26 ] \\\\n wartime leader of china \\\\n chiang kai - shek ( right ) meets with the muslim generals ma bufang ( second from left ) , and ma buqing ( first from left ) in xining at august 1942 . \\\\n chinese civil war : 1927 – 1937 \\\\n after the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 , chiang resigned as chairman of the national government . he returned shortly afterwards , adopting the slogan \\\\\\\" first internal pacification , then external resistance \\\\\\\" . however , this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the japanese was widely unpopular . in 1932 , while chiang was seeking first to defeat the communists , japan launched an advance on shanghai and bombarded nanjing . this disrupted chiang 's offensives against the communists for a time , although it was the northern factions of hu hanmin 's guangzhou ( canton ) government ( notably the 19th route army ) that primarily led the offensive against the japanese during this skirmish . brought into the nationalist army immediately after the battle , the 19th route army 's career under chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies . \\\\n chiang on the cover of a 1933 edition of time magazine \\\\n in december 1936 , chiang flew to xi'an to coordinate a major assault on the red army and the communist republic that had retreated into yan ' an . however , chiang 's allied commander zhang xueliang , whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of manchuria had been recently invaded by the japanese , did not support the attack on the communists . on december 12 , zhang and several other nationalist generals kidnapped chiang for two weeks in what is known as the xi'an incident . they forced chiang into making a \\\\\\\" second united front \\\\\\\" with the communists against japan . after releasing chiang and returning to nanjing with him , zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed . chiang 's commitment to the second united front was nominal at best , and it was all but broken up in 1941 . \\\\n chiang and his wife , soong may - ling , with joseph stilwell in burma ( 1942 ) \\\\n second sino - japanese war : 1937 – 1945 \\\\n the second sino - japanese war broke out in july 1937 , and in august of that year chiang sent 600,000 of his best - trained and equipped soldiers to defend shanghai . with over 200,000 chinese casualties , chiang lost the political cream of his whampoa - trained officers . though chiang lost militarily , the battle dispelled japanese claims that it could conquer china in three months and demonstrated to the western powers that the chinese would continue the fight . by december , the capital city of nanjing had fallen to the japanese , and chiang moved the government inland , first to wuhan and later to chongqing . having lost most of china 's economic and industrial centers , chiang withdrew into the hinterlands , stretching the japanese supply lines and bogging down japanese soldiers in the vast chinese interior . as part of a policy of protracted resistance , chiang authorized the use of scorched earth tactics , resulted in many civilian deaths . during the nationalist 's retreat from nanjing , the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the nationalist army in order to delay the japanese advance , killing 500,000 people in the subsequent 1938 yellow river flood . \\\\n after heavy fighting , the japanese occupied wuhan in the fall of 1938 and the nationalists retreated farther inland , to chongqing . while en route to chongqing , the nationalist army intentionally started the \\\\\\\" fire of changsha \\\\\\\" , as a part of the scorched earth policy . the fire destroyed much of the city , killed twenty thousand civilians , and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless . due to an organizational error ( it was claimed ) , the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city . the nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them . newspapers across china blamed the fire on ( non - kmt ) arsonists , but the blaze contributed to a nation - wide loss of support for the kmt . [ 27 ] \\\\n in 1939 muslim leaders isa yusuf alptekin and ma fuliang were sent by chiang to several middle eastern countries , including egypt , turkey , and syria , to gain support for the chinese war against japan , and to express his support for muslims . [ 28 ] \\\\n the japanese , controlling the puppet - state of manchukuo and much of china 's eastern seaboard , appointed wang jingwei as a quisling - ruler of the occupied chinese territories around nanjing . wang named himself president of the executive yuan and chairman of the national government ( not the same ' national government ' as chiang ' s ) , and led a surprisingly large [ quantify ] minority of anti - chiang / anti - communist chinese against his old comrades . he died in 1944 , within a year of the end of world war ii . \\\\n in 1942 generalissimo chiang kai - shek personally went on tour in northwestern china in xinjiang , gansu , ningxia , shaanxi , and qinghai , where he met both muslim generals ma buqing and ma bufang . [ 29 ] he also met the muslim generals ma hongbin and ma hongkui separately . \\\\n a border crisis erupted with tibet in 1942 . under orders from chiang kai - shek , ma bufang repaired yushu airport to prevent tibetan separatists from seeking independence . [ citation needed ] chiang also ordered ma bufang to put his muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of tibet in 1942 . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] ma bufang complied and moved several thousand troops to the border with tibet . [ 32 ] chiang also threatened the tibetans with aerial bombardment if they worked with the japanese . ma bufang attacked the tibetan buddhist tsang monastery in 1941 . [ 33 ] he also constantly attacked the labrang monastery . [ 34 ] \\\\n chiang kai - shek , franklin d. roosevelt , and winston churchill met at the cairo conference in 1943 during world war ii . \\\\n with the attack on pearl harbor and the opening of the pacific war , china became one of the allied powers . during and after world war ii , chiang and his american - educated wife soong may - ling , known in the united states as \\\\\\\" madame chiang \\\\\\\" , held the support of the united states ' china lobby , which saw in them the hope of a christian and democratic china . chiang was even named the supreme commander of allied forces in the china war zone . he was created a knight grand cross of the order of the bath by king george vi of the united kingdom in 1942 . [ 35 ] \\\\n general joseph stilwell , an american military adviser to chiang during world war ii , strongly criticized chiang and his generals for what he saw as their incompetence and corruption . [ 36 ] in 1944 , the united states army air corps commenced operation matterhorn in order to bomb japan 's steel industry from bases to be constructed in mainland china . this was meant to fulfill president roosevelt 's promise to chiang kai - shek to begin bombing operations against japan by november 1944 . however , chiang kai-shek 's subordinates refused to take air base construction seriously until enough capital had been delivered to permit embezzlement on a massive scale . stilwell estimated that at least half of the $ 100 million spent on construction of airbases was embezzled by nationalist party officials . [ 37 ] \\\\n relationship with the united states \\\\n chiang did not like the americans and was suspicious of their motives . [ 38 ] when he suspected that the american office of strategic services ( forerunner of the cia ) was showing an interest in seizing control of chiang 's regime , chiang ordered the plotters arrested and executed . [ 39 ] chiang felt no friendship towards the united states , and viewed it as pursuing imperialist motives in china . chiang did not want to be subordinate to either the united states or the soviet union but jockeyed for room between the two and wanted to get the most out of the soviet union and the americans without taking sides . [ 40 ] he predicted that war would come between the two and that they would both seek china 's alliance , which he would use to china 's advantage . abusive incidents followed a drunk american general making comments about chiang 's regime , and a low point in sino - american relations followed the rape of a chinese university student by american marines shortly after world war ii . [ 40 ] american officials , notably stilwell , found chiang to be incompetent and corrupt . \\\\n chiang also differed from the americans in ideological issues . he organized the kuomintang as a leninist - style party , oppressed dissension , and banned democracy . [ 41 ] by the end of world war ii , chiang had come to believe that democracy was impossible for china to achieve . [ 42 ] \\\\n chiang played off the soviets and americans against each other during the war . he first told the americans that they would be welcome in talks between the soviet union and china then secretly told the soviets that the americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered . chiang also used american support and military power in china against the ambitions of the soviet union to dominate the talks , stopping the soviets from taking full advantage of the situation in china with the threat of american military action against the soviets . [ 43 ] \\\\n refusal of french indochina \\\\n franklin d. roosevelt , through general stilwell , privately made it clear that they preferred that the french not reacquire french indochina ( modern day vietnam , cambodia , and laos ) after the war was over . roosevelt offered chiang kai - shek control of all of indochina . it was said that chiang kai - shek replied : \\\\\\\" under no circumstances ! \\\\\\\" . [ 44 ] \\\\n after the war , 200,000 chinese troops under general lu han were sent by chiang kai - shek to northern indochina ( north of the 16th parallel ) to accept the surrender of japanese occupying forces there , and remained in indochina until 1946 , when the french returned . [ 45 ] the chinese used the vnq dd , the vietnamese branch of the chinese kuomintang , to increase their influence in indochina and to put pressure on their opponents . [ 46 ] chiang kai - shek threatened the french with war in response to maneuvering by the french and ho chi minh 's forces against each other , forcing them to come to a peace agreement . in february 1946 he also forced the french to surrender all of their concessions in china and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the chinese withdrawing from northern indochina and allowing french troops to reoccupy the region . following france 's agreement to these demands , the withdrawal of chinese troops began in march 1946 . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] \\\\n losing mainland china \\\\n may 20 republican year 37 / 1948 , chiang kai-shek 's inauguration speech as the first president of the republic of china in the new constitution of 1948 \\\\n treatment and use of japanese soldiers \\\\n in 1945 , when japan surrendered , chiang 's chongqing government was ill - equipped and ill - prepared to reassert its authority in formerly japanese - occupied china , and asked the japanese to postpone their surrender until kuomintang ( kmt ) authority could arrive to take over . this was an unpopular move among a population that , for many , had spent more than a decade under often brutal foreign occupation . american troops and weapons soon bolstered kmt forces , allowing them to reclaim cities . the countryside , however , remained largely under communist control . \\\\n for over a year after the japanese surrender , rumors circulated throughout china that the japanese had entered into a secret agreement with chiang , in which the japanese would assist the nationalists in fighting the communists in exchange for the protection of japanese persons and property there . many top nationalist generals , including chiang , had studied and trained in japan before the nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920 s , and maintained close personal friendships with top japanese officers . the japanese general in charge of all forces in china , general okamura , had personally trained officers who later became generals in chiang 's staff . reportedly , general okamura , before surrendering command of all japanese military forces in nanjing , offered chiang control of all 1.5 million japanese military and civilian support staff then present in china . reportedly , chiang seriously considered accepting this offer , but declined only in the knowledge that the united states would certainly be outraged by the gesture . even so , armed japanese troops remained in china well into 1947 , with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the nationalist officer corps . [ 51 ] that the japanese in china came to regard chiang as a magnanimous figure to whom many japanese owed their lives and livelihoods was a fact attested by both nationalist and communist sources . [ 52 ] \\\\n conditions during the chinese civil war \\\\n following the war , the united states encouraged peace talks between chiang and communist leader mao zedong in chongqing . due to concerns about widespread and well - documented corruption in chiang 's government throughout his rule , the u.s. government limited aid to chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948 , in the midst of fighting against the people 's liberation army led by mao zedong . alleged infiltration of the u.s. government by chinese communist agents may have also played a role in the suspension of american aid . [ 53 ] \\\\n chiang 's right hand man , the secret police chief dai li , was both anti - american and anti - communist . [ 54 ] dai ordered kuomintang agents to spy on american officers . [ 55 ] earlier , dai had been involved with the blue shirts society , a fascist - inspired paramilitary group within the kuomintang , which wanted to expel western and japanese imperialists , crush the communists , and eliminate feudalism . [ 56 ] dai li died in a plane crash , which was suspected to be an assassination orchestrated by chiang . [ 57 ] \\\\n though chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader , his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and inflation . in his diary on june 1948 , chiang wrote that the kmt had failed , not because of external enemies but because of rot from with in . [ 58 ] the war had severely weakened the nationalists , while the communists were strengthened by their popular land - reform policies , [ 59 ] and by a rural population that supported and trusted them . the nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men , but their lack of popularity , infiltration by communist agents , low morale , and disorganization soon allowed the communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war . \\\\n competition with li zongren \\\\n a new constitution was promulgated in 1947 , and chiang was formally elected by the national assembly as the first term president of the republic of china on may 20 , 1948 . this marked the beginning of what was termed the \\\\\\\" democratic constitutional government \\\\\\\" period by the kmt political orthodoxy , but the communists refused to recognize the new constitution , and its government , as legitimate . chiang resigned as president on january 21 , 1949 , as kmt forces suffered bitter losses and defections to the communists . after chiang 's resignation the vice-president of the roc , li zongren , became china 's president . \\\\n shortly after chiang 's resignation the communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the roc . li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war , but without success . when it became clear that li was unlikely to accept mao 's terms , the communists issued an ultimatum in april 1949 , warning that they would resume their attacks if li did not agree within five days . li refused . [ 60 ] \\\\n li 's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from chiang 's supporters , and were generally unsuccessful . chiang especially antagonized li by taking possession of ( and moving to taiwan ) us $ 200 million of gold and us dollars belonging to the central government that li desperately needed to cover the government 's soaring expenses . when the communists captured the nationalist capital of nanjing in april 1949 , li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to guangdong , instead expressing his dissatisfaction with chiang by retiring to guangxi . [ 61 ] \\\\n chiang kai - shek and li zongren \\\\n the former warlord yan xishan , who had fled to nanking only one month before , quickly insinuated himself within the li - chiang rivalry , attempting to have li and chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the communists . at chiang 's request yan visited li in order to convince li not to withdraw from public life . yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of shanxi to the communists , and warned li that the nationalist cause was doomed unless li went to guangzhou . li agreed to return under the condition that chiang surrender most of the gold and us dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government , and that chiang stop overriding li 's authority . after yan communicated these demands and chiang agreed to comply with them , li departed for guangdong . [ 61 ] \\\\n in guangdong , li attempted to create a new government composed of both chiang supporters and those opposed to chiang . li 's first choice of premier was chu cheng , a veteran member of the kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to chiang . after the legislative yuan rejected chu , li was obliged to choose yan xishan instead . by this time yan was well known for his adaptability , and chiang welcomed his appointment . [ 61 ] \\\\n conflict between chiang and li persisted . although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of li 's return , chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to taiwan . without being backed by gold or foreign currency , the money issued by li and yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless . [ 62 ] \\\\n although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government , chiang continued to issue orders to the army , and many officers continued to obey chiang rather than li . the inability of li to coordinate kmt military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948 . instead of attempting to defend all of southern china , li ordered what remained of the nationalist armies to withdraw to guangxi and guangdong , hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller , and more easily defensible , area . the object of li 's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the chinese mainland in the hope that the united states would eventually be compelled to enter the war in china on the nationalist side . [ 62 ] \\\\n final communist advance \\\\n chiang opposed li 's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to chiang under the control of li and chiang 's other opponents in the central government . to overcome chiang 's intransigence li began ousting chiang 's supporters within the central government . yan xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides , creating the impression among li 's supporters that he was a \\\\\\\" stooge \\\\\\\" of chiang , while those who supported chiang began to bitterly resent yan for his willingness to work with li . because of the rivalry between chiang and li , chiang refused to allow nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of guangxi and guangdong , with the result that communist forces occupied guangdong in october 1949 . [ 63 ] \\\\n after guangdong fell to the communists , chiang relocated the government to chongqing , while li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to new york for treatment of his chronic duodenum illness at the hospital of columbia university . li visited the president of the united states , harry s. truman , and denounced chiang as a \\\\\\\" dictator \\\\\\\" and an \\\\\\\" usurper . \\\\\\\" li vowed that he would \\\\\\\" return to crush \\\\\\\" chiang once he returned to china . li remained in exile , and did not return to taiwan . [ 64 ] \\\\n in the early morning of december 10 , 1949 , communist troops laid siege to chengdu , the last kmt controlled city in mainland china , where chiang kai - shek and his son chiang ching - kuo directed the defense at the chengdu central military academy . chiang kai - shek , father and son , sang the republic of china national anthem while leaving the academy all the way to the airfield . [ citation needed ] the aircraft may - ling evacuated them to taiwan on the same day . chiang kai - shek would never return to the mainland . \\\\n chiang did not formally re - assume the presidency until march 1, 1950 . on january 1952 , chiang commanded the control yuan , now in taiwan , to impeach li in the \\\\\\\" case of li zongren 's failure to carry out duties due to illegal conduct \\\\\\\" ( 李宗仁 違法 失職 案 ) . chiang officially relieved li of the position as vice-president in the national assembly on march 1954 . \\\\n presidency in taiwan : 1950 – 1975 \\\\n main article : republic of china \\\\n chiang presiding over the 1966 double ten celebrations . \\\\n preparations to retake the mainland \\\\n chiang moved the government to taipei , taiwan , where he formally resumed duties as president of the republic of china on march 1, 1950 . [ 65 ] chiang was reelected by the national assembly to be the president of the republic of china ( roc ) on may 20 , 1954 , and again in 1960 , 1966 , and 1972 . he continued to claim sovereignty over all of china , including the territories held by his government and the people 's republic , as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments , such as tuva and outer mongolia . in the context of the cold war , most of the western world recognized this position and the roc represented china in the united nations and other international organizations until the 1970 s . \\\\n calligraphy chiang kai - shek etched on a rock in quemoy reads , \\\\\\\" forget not that you 're in jǔ \\\\\\\" — an allusion to the warring states period when the state of qi , cornered into the city of ju by the state of yan , successfully counterattacked and retook its territory . this is intended as an analogy to the situation between the republic of china and the people 's republic of china \\\\n during his presidency in taiwan , chiang continued to prepare to take back mainland china . he developed the roc army to prepare for an invasion of the mainland , and to defend taiwan in case of an attack by the communist forces . he also financed armed groups in mainland china , such as muslim soldiers of the roc army left in yunnan under li mi , to continue to fight . it was only in the 1980s that these troops were airlifted to taiwan . [ 66 ] he promoted the uyghur yul bars khan to governor during the kuomintang islamic insurgency in china ( 1950 – 1958 ) for resisting the communists , even though the government had already evacuated to taiwan . [ 67 ] he planned an invasion of the mainland in 1962 . [ 68 ] in the 1950s chiang 's airplanes dropped supplies to kuomintang muslim insurgents in am do . [ 69 ] \\\\n dictatorships \\\\n despite the democratic constitution , the government under chiang was a one - party state , consisting almost completely of mainlanders ; the \\\\\\\" temporary provisions effective during the period of communist rebellion \\\\\\\" greatly enhanced executive powers , and the goal of retaking mainland china allowed the kmt to maintain a monopoly on power and the prohibition of opposition parties . the government 's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary , since the communists and kuomintang ( kmt ) were still in a state of war . seeking to promote chinese nationalism , chiang 's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression , even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions . \\\\n the first decades after the nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist communism known as the \\\\\\\" white terror \\\\\\\" , during which about 140,000 taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the kuomintang . most of those prosecuted were labeled by the kuomintang as \\\\\\\" bandit spies \\\\\\\" ( 匪 諜 ) , meaning spies for chinese communists , and punished as such . under chiang , the government recognized limited civil and economic freedoms , property rights ( personal [ citation needed ] and intellectual ) and other liberties . despite these restrictions , free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted . under the pretext that new elections could not be held in communist - occupied constituencies , the national assembly , legislative yuan , and control yuan members held their posts indefinitely . the temporary provisions also allowed chiang to remain as president beyond the two - term limit in the constitution . he was reelected by the national assembly as president four times — doing so in 1954 , 1960 , 1966 , and 1972 . \\\\n believing that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the kmt lost mainland china to the communists , chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the kmt accused of graft . some major figures in the previous mainland china government , such as h. h. kung and t. v. soong , exiled themselves to the united states . though politically authoritarian and , to some extent , dominated by government - owned industries , chiang 's new taiwanese state also encouraged economic development , especially in the export sector . a popular sweeping land reform act , as well as american foreign aid during the 1950 s , laid the foundation for taiwan 's economic success , becoming one of the four asian tigers . \\\\n after the passing of chiang kai - shek , the next president , chiang 's son , chiang ching - kuo , and chiang ching-kuo 's successor , lee teng - hui a native taiwanese , would , in the 1980s and 1990 s , increase native taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of roc control in taiwan . \\\\n relationships with foreign governments \\\\n japan \\\\n the national chiang kai - shek memorial hall is a famous monument , landmark , and tourist attraction in taipei , taiwan . \\\\n in 1971 , shortly after he had switched his country 's diplomatic recognition from the republic of china to the people 's republic of china , the australian prime minister , gough whitlam , visited japan . after meeting with the japanese prime minister , eisaku sato , whitlam observed that the reason japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the nationalist government was \\\\\\\" the presence of a treaty between the japanese government and that of chiang kai - shek \\\\\\\" . sato explained that the continued recognition of japan towards the nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the japanese government felt towards chiang . this relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of japanese prisoners - of - war by the nationalist government in the years immediately following the japanese surrender in 1945 , and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power . [ 70 ] \\\\n although japan eventually recognized the people 's republic in 1972 , shortly after kakuei tanaka succeeded sato as prime minister of japan , the memory of this relationship was strong enough to be reported by the new york times ( april 15 , 1978 ) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between japan and the mainland . there is speculation that a clash between communist forces and a japanese warship in 1978 was caused by chinese anger after prime minister takeo fukuda attended chiang 's funeral . historically , japanese attempts to normalize their relationship with the people 's republic were met with accusations of ingratitude in taiwan .

1933 . \\\\n chiang 's external problems as leader of the kuomintang regime began when he attempted to exert his influence in the semi - autonomous region of manchuria . this brought him into direct conflict with russia and japan , the two powers who had spheres of influence in the area . the sino - soviet conflict of 1929 was his first confrontation . \\\\n unable to match the japanese on the battlefield , the nationalists signed the tang ku truce in may 1933 and agreed to withdraw from the peking - tientsin area . after signing away part of northern china in the tang ku truce , four years of relative peace with the japanese followed in which chiang again turned his attention on the communists . in 1934 , with the aid of german advisors , chiang devised a military campaign against the communists which was accompanied by an economic blockade that separated and isolated the communists from the people and almost succeeded in destroying them . \\\\n rather than risk total annihilation in a positional battle , the communists broke out of the encirclement and began the \\\\\\\" long march \\\\\\\" from kiang si province to northern shensi province . this six thousand mile march ended in the fall of 1935 with 20,000 of the original 80,000 communists surviving the journey . \\\\n in december of 1936 chiang flew to the headquarters of the manchurian army , at sian , for a first hand look at the situation . on arrival , chiang was kidnapped by the \\\\\\\" young marshal , \\\\\\\" who demanded a united front against japan . chiang refused to negotiate and was released on 25 december , after chou en - lai interceded in chiang 's behalf . \\\\n during the war against the japanese from 1937 to 1945 , chiang was china ’s generalissimo . the japanese eventually gained control of most of the populated areas and economic centers in china and forced chiang to move his government to chungking , deep into the interior of china . even after these defeats chiang refused to surrender and the japanese did not have the manpower to occupy all of china . a deadlock ensued . \\\\n when the united states entered the war against japan , both the communists and nationalists acted as if the war had already been won and began to think in terms of a postwar struggle between themselves . the war with the japanese weakened chiang ’s forces and corruption eroded his government ’s legitimacy . while the nationalists and communists at first cooperated against japan , they soon split . lead by mao tse\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Taiwan -

unless they could defeat these warlords , they would have struggled for nothing . \\\\n chiang kai - shek chiang kai - shek , c. 1924 . \\\\n shortly after sun yat - sen had begun to reorganize the nationalist party along soviet lines , chiang visited the \\\\n soviet union in 1923 to study soviet institutions , especially the red army . back in china after four months , he became commandant of a military academy , established on the soviet model , at \\\\n whampoa , near guangzhou . soviet advisers poured into guangzhou , and at this time the \\\\n chinese communists were admitted into the nationalist party . the chinese communists quickly gained strength , especially after sun ’s death in 1925 , and tensions developed between them and the more conservative elements among the nationalists . chiang , who , with the whampoa army behind him , was the strongest of sun ’s heirs , met this threat with consummate shrewdness . by alternate shows of force and of leniency , he attempted to stem the communists ’ growing influence without losing soviet support . moscow supported him until 1927 , when , in a bloody coup of his own , he finally broke with the communists , expelling them from the nationalist party and suppressing the labour unions they had organized . \\\\n chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling wedding photograph of chiang kai - shek and soong mei - ling , 1927 . \\\\n meanwhile , chiang had gone far toward reunifying the country . commander in chief of the revolutionary army since 1925 , he had launched a massive nationalist campaign against the northern warlords in the following year . this drive ended only in 1928 , when his forces entered beijing , the capital . a new central government under the nationalists , with chiang at its head , was then established at nanjing , farther south . in october 1930 chiang became christian , apparently at the instance of the powerful westernized \\\\n soong family , whose youngest daughter , mei - ling , had become his second wife . as head of the new nationalist government , chiang stood committed to a program of social reform , but most of it remained on paper , partly because his control of the country remained precarious . in the first place , the provincial warlords , whom he had neutralized rather than crushed , still disputed his authority . the communists posed another threat , having withdrawn to rural strongholds and formed their own army and government . in addition , chiang faced certain war with japan , which ,\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Chiang Kai-shek | Biography \\\\u0026 Facts | Britannica\\\",\\\"pos_rune\\\":[2090],\\\"tag_title\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"search_empty\\\":0,\\\"start_index\\\":1855}\"}]},\"message_id\":\"1930680724233474\",\"local_message_id\":\"0f47a850-01b8-11f0-aca0-8d7c166c27af\",\"conversation_id\":\"1937611619616770\",\"local_conversation_id\":\"local_1051142321972252\",\"section_id\":\"1937611619617026\",\"reply_id\":\"1930680724233218\",\"is_delta\":true,\"status\":4,\"input_content_type\":2001,\"message_index\":2,\"bot_id\":\"7338286299411103781\"}","event_id":"87","event_type":2001}

He studied at the Baoding Military Academy and in Japan, where he was influenced by revolutionary ideas and joined the revolutionary movement to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. After the 1911 Revolution, he participated in the struggles against Yuan Shikai. In 1918, he joined Sun Yat - sen and began to build his power.\\n- **Leadership in the Northern Expedition**: After Sun Yat - sen's death, Chiang Kai - shek became the leader of the Kuomintang. In 1926, he launched the Northern Expedition as the commander - in - chief of the National Revolutionary Army, aiming to unify China by overthrowing the warlords. The expedition achieved certain success, and in 1928, the Kuomintang established a new central government in Nanjing with Chiang Kai - shek at its head.\\n- **Split with the Communist Party and civil war**: In 1927, Chiang Kai - shek launched a coup, broke with the Communist Party, and expelled the Communists from the Kuomintang, which led to the breakdown of the first Kuomintang - Communist cooperation and the beginning of the long - term civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In the following years, he launched several \\\"encirclement and suppression\\\" campaigns against the Communist - led base areas.\\n- **Resistance against Japanese aggression**: During the period of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression from 1937 to 1945, Chiang Kai - shek served as the generalissimo of China and led the Chinese military and people in resisting Japanese aggression. Although there were some problems and setbacks in the process, he maintained a stance of not surrendering and played a certain role in the War of Resistance.\\n- **Rule in Taiwan**: After being defeated by the Communist Party in the Chinese civil war in 1949, Chiang Kai - shek retreated to Taiwan with his remaining forces and continued to lead the Republic of China government in exile there. In Taiwan, he imposed martial law and carried out a series of measures to maintain his rule.\\n\\nIn general, Chiang Kai - shek's actions and policies had a significant impact on modern Chinese history. While he achieved some accomplishments in unifying the country and resisting Japanese aggression, his autocratic rule, civil war policies, and other actions also brought great disasters and losses to the Chinese people.\"}","event_id":"102","event_type":2001}
