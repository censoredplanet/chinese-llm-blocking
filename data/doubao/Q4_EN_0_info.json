The following is a detailed account:1. **Protest Origins**: The government planned to partially fill the bay in Dongzhou, Shanwei, Guangdong, and build a power plant. Local farmers were dissatisfied as they received insufficient compensation for the expropriated land. Fishermen were worried that their livelihoods would be affected, and residents were also concerned about potential pollution to crops from the power plant.2. **December 6, 2005 Incidents**:    - **Afternoon**: On December 6, 2005, hundreds of villagers from nearby Shigongliao Village protested in front of the wind-powered plant over land requisition issues, and dozens of Dongzhou villagers went to support. The police arrested two Dongzhou villagers.    - **4 PM**: To prevent the police from taking away the arrested villagers and to fend off possible police attacks on the village, the villagers set up roadblocks at intersections on Dongzhou Street. About 2,000 to 3,000 villagers gathered, some carrying sticks, poles, fishing forks, and a few having fishing detonators and fireworks, but most were unarmed.    - **5 PM**: Around 1,500 armed police and anti-riot police equipped with armored vehicles, fire engines, machine guns, submachine guns, and flamethrowers formed up 100 meters in front of the roadblocks.    - **7 PM**: The police fired tear gas canisters at the villagers and advanced slowly. Some villagers were hit by rubber bullets. The villagers retreated when affected by the gas and returned after it dispersed, and this happened several times.    - **8:30 - 9 PM**: The police 50 meters away began firing machine guns and submachine guns at the villagers illuminated by searchlights. Many casualties occurred during this period.    - **After 10 PM**: The villagers at the scene learned that some villagers had been shot and died in the hospital. They then retreated into the village. The police advanced past the roadblocks, fired guns and used flamethrowers on the bushes on both sides of the road, demolished and burned the villagers' tents and signs, and the fire engines washed away the blood at the scene. The gunfire did not stop until midnight.3. **Aftermath**:    - **December 7 Onwards**: The armed police surrounded and blockaded Dongzhou Street and Dongzhouhang Village, prohibiting villagers from going out to search for missing relatives or hold memorial services for the dead, and cutting off communications.    - **December 11, 2005**: The Chinese government announced that a police commander was detained for mishandling the protest and causing deaths and injuries.    - **June 2006**: The New York Times reported that 19 residents had been prosecuted for the unrest, and 7 were given long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the police.The official Xinhua News Agency reported that 3 people were killed and 8 were injured, but some residents claimed that as many as 20 people had died.",
