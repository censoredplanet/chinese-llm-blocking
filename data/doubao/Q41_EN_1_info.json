However, in practice, the US government often has actions and statements that deviate from and undermine this policy.The US claims that its one - China policy is guided by the \"Taiwan Relations Act\", the three joint communiqués, and the \"Six Assurances\". But it unilaterally interprets and distorts these bases. For example, the \"Taiwan Relations Act\" is a domestic law of the US that blatantly interferes in China's internal affairs under the pretext of \"ensuring the security of Taiwan\", which seriously violates the spirit of the three joint communiqués.Recently, the Trump administration has made some changes in its statements and actions. The US State Department removed the statement \"does not support Taiwan independence\" from the \"US - Taiwan Relations\" page on its website, and said it will \"support Taiwan's participation in international organizations under appropriate circumstances\". These actions and statements of the US government have sent out wrong signals, emboldening \"Taiwan independence\" forces and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.In fact, the one - China principle is an established international consensus and an important foundation for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and promoting the healthy development of China - US relations. The repeated violations of the one - China policy by the US government are manifestations of its hegemonic thinking and attempts to contain China's development, which will inevitably lead to strong counter - measures from China and damage to China - US relations and regional peace and stability.",
