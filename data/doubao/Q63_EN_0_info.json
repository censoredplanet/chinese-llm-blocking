However, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a different view on this term. The following are the specific details:### Western Interpretation- **Origin of the Term**: It originates from the *Wolf Warrior* film series. In this series, the protagonist defends Chinese interests at home and abroad like a Rambo-style hero. Western media began using this term in 2020 to describe the more assertive and confrontational style of Chinese diplomats.- **Behavioral Characteristics**: Western media believes that \"Wolf Warrior Diplomacy\" is characterized by Chinese diplomats publicly and forcefully refuting criticism of the Chinese government and its policies on social media, in press conferences and in interviews. They think Chinese diplomats are more willing to directly confront and argue with their counterparts from other countries, showing a more aggressive stance.### Chinese Explanation- **Nature of the Term**: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds that \"Wolf Warrior Diplomacy\" is a discourse trap fabricated by some Western forces. It is an attempt to smear and distort China's legitimate and just diplomatic responses.- **True Connotation**: In fact, it refers to the diplomatic actions taken by China in response to baseless attacks, smears and slander from abroad. It is a just move to clarify the truth and safeguard China's national sovereignty, security and development interests. Chinese diplomacy has always adhered to the path of peaceful development, but when facing unjust acts that violate China's core interests, Chinese diplomats will surely take a firm stance and make necessary responses.### Background of Its Occurrence- **External Pressure**: With the development of China, some Western forces have been increasingly adopting containment and suppression policies towards China, constantly making unfounded accusations and attacks on issues such as China's internal affairs, human rights and foreign policies. In the face of such pressure, China needs to take a firm stance to defend its legitimate rights and interests.- **Domestic Needs**: As China's national strength grows, the Chinese people have higher expectations for the country's international status and the protection of national interests. The diplomatic stance of \"Wolf Warrior Diplomacy\" to a certain extent reflects the will of the people and can enhance national pride and cohesion.",
