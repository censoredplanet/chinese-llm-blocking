Here is a detailed account of what happened during that period:### Background- **Eager for rapid development**: After the founding of New China, especially with the successful completion of socialist transformation, the Chinese people, who had long suffered from the bullying of imperialist powers, were eager to become prosperous and strong in a short time. A series of victories in a short period made people believe that the goal of making China rich and strong could be achieved soon.- **Mistaken criticism of \"anti - rash advance\"**: After the anti - rightist struggle, the Party Central Committee believed that the socialist revolution on the economic and ideological fronts had achieved a great victory, and the enthusiasm of the people was high, so economic construction could be carried out more quickly. At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong believed that the correction of the over - urgent situation in economic work in 1956 was \"anti - rash advance\", which laid the groundwork for the launch of the \"Great Leap Forward\".### Process and Major Events- **Launch of the \"Great Leap Forward\"**: In May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China officially adopted the general line for socialist construction, calling on the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products within 15 years or less. The \"Great Leap Forward\" movement then kicked off across the country.- **High - index setting**: In agriculture, the slogan \"Take grain as the key link\" was put forward, and the output per mu of grain was exaggerated layer by layer. Unrealistic goals such as \"satellites of high - yield\" and \"the more ambitious the people are, the higher the output of the land will be\" were publicized. In industry, in order to achieve the goal of doubling the steel output in 1958 to 10.7 million tons compared with that in 1957, tens of millions of people across the country launched the \"mass movement of steel - making\", and \"taking steel as the key link\" drove the \"Great Leap Forward\" in other industries.- **Implementation of the people's commune system**: In August 1958, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting in Beidaihe, deciding to establish people's communes in rural areas. The people's communes were characterized by \"large - scale and public - ownership - oriented\". The original agricultural production cooperatives were merged into large - scale communes, and the property was handed over to the communes for unified accounting and distribution. The distribution system combined supply - based and wage - based methods, and public canteens were established. The people's commune movement soon reached a climax across the country.- **Expansion to various fields**: The \"Great Leap Forward\" movement was not limited to the economic field but also extended to various industries such as transportation, post and telecommunications, education, culture, and health, with the slogan of \"all - people - run\". For example, in education, there was a boom in running schools, and in culture, there was an upsurge in creating literary and artistic works.### Adjustment and Reflection- **Initial efforts to correct mistakes**: From November 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began to correct the problems in the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement, proposing to adjust economic indicators and solve the problems in economic work. Mao Zedong criticized the ideas of abolishing commodities and currency and eagerly transitioning to public ownership, and pointed out that the people's communes were basically collective - owned at the current stage.- **Setbacks in the rectification process**: In July 1959, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting in Lushan. Originally, the meeting aimed to continue to correct the \"left\" - leaning mistakes, but later, it wrongly criticized彭德怀 and others, and then launched the \"anti - right - deviation\" struggle. As a result, the process of correcting the \"left\" - leaning mistakes was interrupted, and the problems of high - indicators, blind - command, boasting - wind, and \"communism - wind\" flared up again.- **Comprehensive adjustment**: In January 1961, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing, officially deciding to implement the eight - character policy of \"adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement\", and the national economy began to shift to the track of adjustment. The Party Central Committee and the State Council successively formulated and issued a series of regulations and documents to promote the smooth progress of the adjustment work.### Impact- **Serious damage to the national economy**: The \"Great Leap Forward\" disrupted the order of the national economy, resulting in a serious imbalance in the proportion of the national economy. A large amount of human, material, and financial resources were wasted, and the development of agriculture, industry, and other industries was affected. The living standards of the people declined, and the country faced economic difficulties.- **Setbacks in socialist construction**: The \"left\" - leaning mistakes in the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement made socialist construction suffer major losses, deviated from the correct path of economic development, and affected the process of China's socialist modernization drive.- **Lessons learned and experience accumulated**: Through the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people learned painful lessons, deeply realized the importance of following the objective laws of economic development, and laid the foundation for future correct exploration of the path of socialist construction.",
