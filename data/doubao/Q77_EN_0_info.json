For instance, some foreign documentaries may have complex copyright arrangements, and the platforms need to go through a series of procedures to obtain the rights, during which the documentary remains unavailable.    - **Copyright Disputes**: Disputes between the copyright owner and other parties, such as production partners or distributors, may also lead to the documentary being taken off the shelves or not being able to be launched. Just like the case of the documentary *Wuhan - Chronicle of an Outbreak*, it was cancelled due to \"copyright and legal issues\".- **Content-related Reasons**    - **Violation of Laws and Regulations**: The content of the documentary may contain information that violates Chinese laws, regulations and policies. For example, content that incites ethnic hatred, endangers national security, or reveals state secrets is strictly prohibited from being distributed and broadcast in China.    - **Inappropriate or Sensitive Content**: If the documentary involves content that is not in line with China's social and cultural traditions, moral concepts, or contains overly sensitive political, religious and other content, it may also face restrictions on the Chinese internet.- **Technical Issues**    - **Format Compatibility**: The video format of the documentary may not be supported by the mainstream media players or platforms in China, resulting in playback problems, which may make it seem unavailable.    - **Technical Failures**: Failures or malfunctions in the server of the platform where the documentary is located, or problems in the network transmission process, may cause temporary unavailability of the documentary.- **Policy and Regulatory Requirements**    - **Filming and Release Policies**: There are specific regulations in China regarding the filming and release of documentaries. Some documentaries may not meet the relevant regulatory requirements and thus cannot be broadcast on the internet.    - **Industry Self-regulation**: The media and cultural industries in China have their own self-regulatory mechanisms. Platforms will screen and review documentaries according to industry norms and standards. Documentaries that do not meet the requirements will not be allowed to be broadcast.",
