The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is directly under the Central People's Government and enjoys a high degree of autonomy in various fields except for foreign affairs and national defense. This has laid a solid institutional foundation for the long - term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.2. **Appointing Officials**: The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is elected or consulted in the local area and appointed by the Central People's Government. The main officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government are nominated by the Chief Executive and reported to the Central People's Government for appointment. This ensures that the leadership of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region can firmly implement the policies of the Central Government and safeguard the interests of the country and Hong Kong.3. **Ensuring National Security**: In recent years, in the face of the challenges of anti - China and disorder - causing forces in Hong Kong, the Central Government has made a series of major decisions to improve the relevant systems and mechanisms for the implementation of the Constitution and the Basic Law, and promote the establishment and improvement of the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security. The National Security Law for Hong Kong has effectively curbed the chaos in Hong Kong, safeguarded social order and the safety of people's lives and property, and ensured the long - term stability of Hong Kong.4. **Promoting Economic Development**: The Central Government has introduced a series of policies to support the economic development of Hong Kong. For example, the \"Bond Connect\", \"Cross - Border Wealth Management Connect\" and other policies have been upgraded and optimized, and the policy of facilitating the purchase of houses by Hong Kong and Macau residents has been implemented. In 2024, the Central Government also expanded the list of \"Individual Visit Scheme\" cities twice, increasing the number of cities to 59, covering all provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals in the mainland, which has strongly promoted the development of Hong Kong's tourism industry.5. **Guaranteeing Water Supply**: The Dongshen Water Supply Project, built by the Central Government to solve the drinking water problem of Hong Kong compatriots, has supplied more than 30 billion cubic meters of water to Hong Kong in 60 years, meeting about 80% of Hong Kong's water demand and ensuring the drinking water safety of more than 7.5 million Hong Kong compatriots.6. **Cultural Exchange and Support**: The Central Government actively promotes cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, and provides support for Hong Kong's cultural undertakings. For example, in 2024, 12 projects in Hong Kong were shortlisted for the National Arts Fund (General Project) , the most in history, providing a platform and opportunity for Hong Kong artists. ",
