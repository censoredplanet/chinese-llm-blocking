The following is a detailed introduction:- **Historical basis**: As early as the 3rd century AD, the people of the Wu state in the Three Kingdoms period went to Taiwan. In the Sui Dynasty, the government sent troops to Taiwan three times. After the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the central governments of all dynasties in China began to set up administrative institutions in Penghu and Taiwan to exercise jurisdiction. In 1624, Dutch colonists occupied southern Taiwan, and in 1662, national hero Zheng Chenggong expelled the Dutch colonists and recovered Taiwan. In 1684, the Qing government established the Taiwan Prefecture, which was subordinate to Fujian Province, and in 1885, Taiwan was upgraded to a provincial administrative region.
