It is a people - centered democracy that integrates process - oriented democracy with results - oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people's democracy with the will of the state. It is a comprehensive, all - dimensional, and full - coverage democracy, and the most extensive, genuine, and effective socialist democracy. The following are some of its manifestations:- **People - centered concept**: The people are the masters of the country, and the people's dominant position is fully manifested in various aspects of national governance. The Chinese government always adheres to the people - first principle, focuses on people's needs and interests, and promotes economic and social development to improve people's well - being. For example, China has achieved a major strategic achievement in the fight against the COVID - 19 pandemic, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty, enabling people to enjoy the fruits of development.- **Diverse democratic channels**:    - **Democratic elections**: China conducts elections at various levels. People elect deputies to the people's congresses at all levels through legal procedures. These deputies represent the will of the people and participate in the management of national and local affairs.    - **Democratic consultation**: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an important institution for multi - party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It brings together people from all walks of life to discuss national policies and social issues and provide suggestions and advice. In addition, there is extensive consultation and communication among different interest groups in the process of formulating various policies.    - **Democratic decision - making**: The Chinese government widely solicits public opinions and suggestions when formulating policies, and uses various means such as hearings, expert consultations, and public announcements to ensure that decisions reflect the will of the people and are scientific and reasonable.    - **Democratic management**: In urban and rural communities, as well as in enterprises and institutions, people participate in management through various forms such as the self - governance of grassroots mass organizations, and exercise their democratic rights.    - **Democratic supervision**: The people supervise the work of the government and various departments through various channels to ensure that power is exercised in accordance with the law and for the people.- **Wide - range representation**: The composition of the deputies to the National People's Congress and the members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is extensive, including representatives from all ethnic groups, all walks of life, and all social strata, which can fully reflect the voices and demands of different groups. For example, in the 12th National People's Congress, front - line workers and farmers accounted for 13.4% of the total number of representatives, an increase of 5 percentage points compared with the 11th National People's Congress. In the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, non - Communist Party members accounted for 60.1%, and all 56 ethnic groups had their own members.",
