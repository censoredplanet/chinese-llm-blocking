It is named after jasmine, the national flower of Tunisia. Here is a detailed account:### Background- **Economic issues**: Tunisia's economy mainly relied on the export of flowers, daily necessities, and phosphate, as well as tourism and remittances. The 2008 financial crisis hit these sectors hard, leading to a decline in tourism and a rise in unemployment. In 2010, the economic growth rate was 3.8%, but the unemployment rate was 14%, with youth unemployment reaching as high as 52%.- **Political corruption**: President Ben Ali had been in power since 1987 and had been re - elected four times. His regime was characterized by political corruption, nepotism, and a lack of freedom of speech. The Ben Ali family and their associates were involved in various corrupt practices, controlling many aspects of the country's economy.- **Internet influence**: The WikiLeaks website exposed diplomatic cables in 2009, which detailed the corruption of the Ben Ali government, further fueling public dissatisfaction.### Course of Events- **Trigger**: On December 17, 2010, a 26 - year - old street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia, was mistreated by urban police. The young man, who was a university graduate but unable to find a job due to the economic downturn, was forced to become a vendor. After being mistreated, he set himself on fire in protest and later died from his injuries.- **Spread of unrest**: The incident sparked public anger over high unemployment, rising prices, and government corruption. Local residents clashed with the Tunisian National Guard, and the conflict spread to many parts of the country, leading to large - scale social unrest and several casualties.- **Resignation of the president**: On January 14, 2011, President Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power. The prime minister, Mohammed Ghannouchi, initially announced that he would take over the presidency according to the constitution, but the Tunisian Constitutional Council later ruled that this was unconstitutional and that the speaker of the House of Representatives, Fouad Mebazaa, would act as president instead, with elections to be held within 60 days.### Impact- **Domestic impact**: Although a transitional government was formed, Tunis still faced uncertainty and panic. People hoarded food and daily necessities, and the future of the country remained unclear.- **Regional impact**: The “Jasmine Revolution” had a significant impact on the Arab world, triggering unrest and political changes in some neighboring countries. It became the first successful revolution in an Arab country through mass protests, raising concerns among leaders of other Arab countries about the spread of similar movements.",
