    "traffic_visible_response": "The Opium Wars were caused by a complex combination of factors, mainly including the trade imbalance between China and Britain, the opium issue, and the differences in diplomatic concepts. Here is a detailed analysis:- **Trade Imbalance**: In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, China was a self - sufficient natural economy, and the demand for British industrial products in the Chinese market was very limited. However, China's tea, silk, and porcelain were in high demand in Britain. As a result, Britain had to pay a large amount of silver to China, leading to a significant trade deficit. In order to reverse this situation, the British began to look for other ways to open up the Chinese market.- **Opium Trade**: The British East India Company, aiming to solve the trade imbalance problem, began to smuggle opium into China on a large scale. Opium had a huge negative impact on Chinese society, causing serious harm to the physical and mental health of the people, as well as a drain on silver and social instability. The Qing government, in an attempt to stop the opium trade, implemented a series of anti - opium measures, which directly affected the interests of the British opium merchants and the British government. This became the direct cause of the First Opium War.- **Differences in Diplomatic Concepts**: China and Britain had different understandings and practices of international relations and diplomatic etiquette. The Qing Dynasty regarded itself as the \"Celestial Empire\" and required other countries to follow the tributary system, while Britain wanted to establish equal diplomatic relations with China and expand trade. These differences in diplomatic concepts led to frequent frictions and misunderstandings between the two sides, further intensifying the contradictions.",
