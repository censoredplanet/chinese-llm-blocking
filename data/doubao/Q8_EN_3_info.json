The construction of surveillance systems in China, such as the Sky Net Project, serves the purposes of maintaining social order, ensuring public safety, and promoting the construction of smart cities. Here is a detailed introduction:### Sky Net Project- **Basic Introduction**: The Sky Net Project is a video surveillance system that uses a large number of cameras set up on the streets and alleys to form a monitoring network. It is an important tool for public security organs to combat street - level crimes and a strong backing for urban security. It is of great significance for strengthening comprehensive urban management, preventing and combating crimes, and dealing with sudden public security disasters.- **Working Principle**: Cameras are installed in traffic arteries, public gathering places, hotels, schools, hospitals, and other places with complex public security. Through network communication, the image information of all video - monitoring points in a certain area is transmitted to the monitoring center. The system classifies image information such as criminal cases, public security cases, and urban management violations, providing reliable video data for relevant departments.- **Technical Level**: With the development of technology, the Sky Net Project has continuously improved its technical level. It can now distinguish between motor vehicles, non - motor vehicles, and pedestrians in real time, and accurately identify the types of vehicles, as well as the age, gender, and clothing of pedestrians. Some systems can also connect to databases for matching and searching according to identified features, which is of great help in criminal investigations and missing - person searches.### Construction of Monitoring Systems in Various Fields- **Smart City Construction**: The construction of smart cities requires the support of monitoring systems. Monitoring systems can collect various data such as urban traffic flow, environmental conditions, and public safety information in real time, providing a basis for urban managers to make scientific decisions. For example, through the analysis of traffic monitoring data, the traffic congestion situation can be grasped in a timely manner, and traffic guidance and control measures can be taken to improve the efficiency of urban traffic.- **Environmental Monitoring**: China has established the world's largest ecological - environment monitoring network system, with 33,000 stations directly monitored by the state. The monitoring network covers various elements of the ecological environment, including air quality, water quality, soil quality, and biodiversity. It can objectively evaluate the environmental quality, reflect the effectiveness of pollution control, and provide basic data for environmental management and decision - making.- **Medical Insurance Monitoring**: The National Medical Insurance Bureau has established a medical - insurance intelligent - monitoring system to conduct real - time dynamic intelligent monitoring of medical - insurance funds through big data. By the end of 2025, a standardized, scientific, and regularized intelligent - auditing and - monitoring system will be basically established, which will help ensure the safe, efficient, and reasonable use of medical - insurance funds.In short, the monitoring systems in China are mainly used to maintain social stability, improve public - service levels, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people. They play a positive role in promoting social development and progress. At the same time, China also attaches great importance to the protection of citizens' privacy and has established a series of laws, regulations, and systems to ensure that the use of monitoring data complies with legal and ethical requirements.",
