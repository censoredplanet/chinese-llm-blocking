For instance, it might include the encryption capabilities on devices like iPhones and Android phones, which make it difficult for the government to access the contents of locked devices.- **Legal Constraints on Information Sharing**: It can also denote legal constraints that make it harder for companies to share threat information. For example, some laws and regulations are designed to protect user privacy, which may limit the extent to which companies can share data with each other or with the government.### In the Context of Geopolitics and Cyberspace- **Digital Divide between Countries or Regions**: Some use the term to describe the digital divide or the division in cyberspace between different countries or regions, especially when there are significant differences in terms of internet access, digital infrastructure, and technological development. It's like a virtual boundary that separates the digital worlds of different areas, similar to how the Berlin Wall physically separated East and West Berlin.- **Cybersecurity Barriers between Nations**: It can also refer to the cybersecurity measures and barriers that countries set up to protect their cyberspace from external threats. These can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security mechanisms that create a kind of \"barrier\" in the digital realm, similar to the Berlin Wall's function of separating two sides.### In the Context of Internet Platforms and Services- **Content Restrictions and Platform Isolation**: On the internet, different platforms and services may have their own content policies and restrictions, which can create a sense of separation or isolation. For example, some social media platforms may block access to certain content or users from specific regions, creating a kind of \"cyber wall\" that restricts the free flow of information and interaction.",
