The following were the main events and phenomena during this period:- **Launch and Development**    - **Ideological Mobilization**: After the anti - rightist struggle, the Party Central Committee believed that socialist revolutions on the economic and ideological fronts had achieved great victories, and that the enthusiasm of the people was high, so economic construction could be carried out at a faster pace. In September 1957, at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong believed that the correction of the overly hasty economic work in 1956 was \"anti - leap - forward\". The plenary session passed the \"Fourteen - Article Amendment Draft of the Agricultural Development Program\", which was actually the program for the agricultural \"Great Leap Forward\". On November 13, the People's Daily published an editorial proposing the slogan of the \"Great Leap Forward\".    - **Formulation of the General Line**: In May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China officially adopted the general line for socialist construction, calling on the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products within 15 years or even less. The meeting also adopted the Second Five - Year Plan, putting forward a series of unrealistic tasks and targets.    - **Full - Scale Upsurge**: In August 1958, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting in Beidaihe, setting overly high main indicators for the 1958 national economic plan. It was proposed that the steel output in 1958 should double on the basis of 5.35 million tons in 1957, reaching 10.7 million tons. The meeting also decided to generally establish people's communes in rural areas. Subsequently, the whole country launched a campaign of \"steel - making by all the people\" and the movement of establishing people's communes in rural areas. At the same time, various undertakings such as transportation, posts and telecommunications, education, culture, and health also carried out the \"all - people - run\" model, pushing the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement to a climax.- **Main Manifestations**    - **High - Index Campaign**: In agriculture, the slogan \"Taking Grain as the Key Link\" was put forward, and the \"high - yield satellite\" was continuously publicized. The yield per mu of grain was exaggerated layer by layer. In industry, in order to achieve the target of 10.7 million tons of steel output for the whole year, tens of millions of people across the country launched the \"steel - making by all the people\" movement. With \"steel as the key link\", it drove the \"Great Leap Forward\" in other industries.    - **瞎指挥**：Many areas and departments violated scientific common sense and normal management in the process of implementing high - index tasks. For example, in agricultural production, some places blindly promoted deep - plowing and close - planting without considering the actual situation of the land, resulting in a waste of labor and a decrease in production.    - **浮夸风**：There was widespread false reporting of production achievements. Newspapers and periodicals publicized some extremely high - yield \"satellites\", such as claims of extremely high - yield per mu of grain, which misled the central leadership's judgment on the production situation and led to the formulation of even higher production targets.    - **共产风**：This was mainly manifested in the people's commune movement. Many areas carried out \"equalization, free - of - charge transfer, and withdrawal of funds\", that is, the equal - distribution system, the free transfer of production materials and funds from lower - level units and individuals, which seriously damaged the production enthusiasm of farmers.- **Adjustment and Rectification**    - **Initial Rectification**: From November 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began to correct the problems in the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement. The central government repeatedly proposed to adjust economic indicators and \"deflate the balloon\", and set about solving the problems in economic work. Mao Zedong criticized the idea of abolishing commodities and currencies and eagerly transitioning to public ownership, pointing out that the current stage was socialism, and the people's communes were basically collective ownership.    - **Setbacks in Rectification**: In the latter half of the Lushan Conference in July - August 1959,彭德怀 and others were wrongly criticized, and then the \"anti - right - deviation\" struggle was launched, which reversed the good trend of rectifying the \"left\" - leaning mistakes. The high - index, blind - command, exaggeration - style, and \"communism - style\" errors flooded again, resulting in a serious crisis in China's national economy.    - **Suspension of the Movement**: In the winter of 1960, as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began to correct the \"left\" - leaning mistakes in rural work, the \"Great Leap Forward\" movement was stopped. The enlarged Central Work Conference attended by 7,000 people held in January 1962 initially summarized the experience and lessons of the \"Great Leap Forward\" and carried out criticism and self - criticism.The \"Great Leap Forward\" disrupted the order of the national economy, wasted a large amount of human and material resources, caused a serious imbalance in the proportion of the national economy, and made the cause of socialist construction suffer major losses. However, through this exploration, the Communist Party of China also learned valuable experience and lessons, which laid the foundation for the subsequent adjustment of the national economy and the continuous exploration of the path of socialist construction.",
