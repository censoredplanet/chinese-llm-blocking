Here is a detailed introduction:- **Trade Imbalance**: In the 18th and early 19th centuries, China had a prosperous natural economy and mainly exported tea, silk, and porcelain to Western countries. However, China had little demand for Western industrial products, resulting in a large trade surplus for China and a deficit for Britain. To change this situation, Britain hoped to open up the Chinese market and find a commodity that could balance the trade deficit.- **Opium Trade**: Opium was a highly profitable commodity, and the British East India Company began to smuggle opium into China on a large scale from the late 18th century. The opium trade not only brought huge profits to British merchants but also gradually reversed the trade imbalance between Britain and China. However, the opium trade brought serious disasters to China, such as the deterioration of people's physical and mental health, the outflow of silver, and the decline of social productivity.- **Chinese Government's Anti - Opium Campaign**: In order to safeguard national sovereignty, social stability, and the health of the people, the Qing government decided to carry out a strict anti - opium campaign. Lin Zexu's destruction of opium in Humen in 1839 was a powerful blow to the British opium trade. This behavior angered the British, who saw it as an infringement of their economic interests and an excuse to launch a war against China.- **Collision of Cultures and Systems**: There were significant differences in culture, values, and political systems between China and the West. The Western powers, with the idea of expansion and the pursuit of profit - making, hoped to open up the Chinese market and impose their own values and systems on China. The Qing Dynasty, on the other hand, adhered to the traditional feudal system and the concept of \"closing the country to foreign trade\", which led to conflicts and misunderstandings between the two sides in communication and trade. These cultural and systemic differences also contributed to the intensification of矛盾 and ultimately led to war.",
