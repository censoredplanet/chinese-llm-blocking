    "traffic_visible_response": "正在搜索找到 4 篇资料参考The Senkaku Islands are an inherent part of China's territory. China has indisputable sovereignty over them, supported by strong historical, geographical, and legal evidence.### Historical basis- **Naming and use**: As early as the Ming and Qing dynasties, China had named and used the Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands (the Senkaku Islands). In 1534, Chen Kan's *Record of an Imperial Envoy to Ryukyu* mentioned the route from China to Ryukyu, passing by \"Diaoyu Dao, Huangmao Yu, Chi Yu\", and clearly stated that \"Diaoyu Dao and Chiwei Yu belong to China, and Kume Island belongs to Ryukyu, with the dividing line being the Hei Shui Gou (now the Okinawa Trough) between Chiwei Yu and Kume Island\".- **Jurisdiction**: During the Ming Dynasty, the Diaoyu Islands were within the scope of coastal defense and were an important part of the coastal defense zone. The Qing Dynasty placed the Diaoyu Islands under the jurisdiction of Taiwan. For example, *A Tour of Duty in the Taiwan Strait* and *Recompiled General Annals of Fujian* both recorded that the Diaoyu Dao was among the strategic coastal defense zones under the jurisdiction of Gamalan (now Yilan County, Taiwan).### Geographical basisThe Senkaku Islands are located to the east of China's Taiwan Island, in the natural extension of the continental shelf of the East China Sea. They are geographically an inalienable part of the Taiwan - Penghu - Ryukyu arc - shaped chain of islands.### Legal basis- After World War II, international law clearly defined that Japan should return all the territories it had occupied, including Taiwan and its affiliated islands, to China.
