year - old wife and his 47 - year - old son died within a few weeks of each other . both suffered from a genetic kidney disease that required constant dialysis , for which heparin is routinely used . \\\\n “ as christmas music softly played in the background , we each said our goodbyes , ” mr. hubley said , breaking down in tears . “ then my wife and love of 48 years drifted away . ” \\\\n he did not know for weeks after their deaths that his wife , bonnie , and son , randy , had been given contaminated heparin . \\\\n “ now i am left to deal not only with the pain of losing my wife and son , but anger that an unsafe drug was permitted to be sold in this country , ” he said . \\\\n david g. strunce , chief executive of scientific protein laboratories , the company that supplied contaminated heparin material to baxter international , which manufactured and distributed the finished drug , described the contamination as “ an insidious act ” that “ seems to us an intentional act upstream in the supply chain . ” \\\\n the f.d.a. has identified changzhou spl , a chinese subsidiary of scientific protein laboratories , as the source of the contaminated heparin . a congressional investigator said the contaminant , oversulfated chondroitin sulfate , cost $ 9 a pound compared with $ 900 a pound for heparin . \\\\n mr. strunce said that his company tried to find the original source of the contamination but was stopped by the chinese authorities . \\\\n robert l. parkinson , baxter ’s chairman and chief executive , told the committee , “we ’re alarmed that one of our products was used in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme to adulterate a life - saving medication . ” \\\\n chinese officials have disputed the f.d.a. contention that the contaminant caused death and injury , and they have insisted on the right to inspect american drug plants if the f.d.a. insists on inspecting chinese ones . \\\\n david nelson , a congressional investigator , told the house panel that had the f.d.a. inspected the chinese plant , the contamination could have been averted . \\\\n f.d.a. officials have admitted that they mistakenly failed to conduct an inspection of the changzhou spl plant but said that an inspection would not have been able to uncover the contamination . \\\\n the agency finally conducted an inspection of the facility in february and found so many problems that the f.d.a. blocked the plant from exporting to the united states . mr. nelson was even more critical of baxter international , which bought heparin ingredients from changzhou spl from 2004 through 2008 but did not inspect the facility until september 2007 . \\\\n the company sent one person who spent one day in the plant , mr. nelson said . five months later , the f.d.a. discovered myriad problems , he said . \\\\n “ it really is impossible for a plant to have fallen that far out of compliance in five months , ” mr. nelson said . \\\\n under withering questioning , dr. woodcock said that the f.d.a. would need another $ 225 million annually to inspect every foreign drug plant every other year , the frequency most say is needed . the agency will spend $ 11 million this year on foreign drug inspections . \\\\n there is a growing bipartisan consensus on capitol hill that the f.d.a. needs a rapid increase in its budget to ensure the safety of the nation ’s drugs , medical devices and food . \\\\n the bush administration has proposed increasing the agency ’s budget next year by only 3 percent to $ 1 . 8 billion , not enough to cover even its expected cost increases .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Heparin Contamination May Have Been Deliberate, F.D.A.

year - old wife and his 47 - year - old son died within a few weeks of each other . both suffered from a genetic kidney disease that required constant dialysis , for which heparin is routinely used . \\\\n “ as christmas music softly played in the background , we each said our goodbyes , ” mr. hubley said , breaking down in tears . “ then my wife and love of 48 years drifted away . ” \\\\n he did not know for weeks after their deaths that his wife , bonnie , and son , randy , had been given contaminated heparin . \\\\n “ now i am left to deal not only with the pain of losing my wife and son , but anger that an unsafe drug was permitted to be sold in this country , ” he said . \\\\n david g. strunce , chief executive of scientific protein laboratories , the company that supplied contaminated heparin material to baxter international , which manufactured and distributed the finished drug , described the contamination as “ an insidious act ” that “ seems to us an intentional act upstream in the supply chain . ” \\\\n the f.d.a. has identified changzhou spl , a chinese subsidiary of scientific protein laboratories , as the source of the contaminated heparin . a congressional investigator said the contaminant , oversulfated chondroitin sulfate , cost $ 9 a pound compared with $ 900 a pound for heparin . \\\\n mr. strunce said that his company tried to find the original source of the contamination but was stopped by the chinese authorities . \\\\n robert l. parkinson , baxter ’s chairman and chief executive , told the committee , “we ’re alarmed that one of our products was used in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme to adulterate a life - saving medication . ” \\\\n chinese officials have disputed the f.d.a. contention that the contaminant caused death and injury , and they have insisted on the right to inspect american drug plants if the f.d.a. insists on inspecting chinese ones . \\\\n david nelson , a congressional investigator , told the house panel that had the f.d.a. inspected the chinese plant , the contamination could have been averted . \\\\n f.d.a. officials have admitted that they mistakenly failed to conduct an inspection of the changzhou spl plant but said that an inspection would not have been able to uncover the contamination . \\\\n the agency finally conducted an inspection of the facility in february and found so many problems that the f.d.a. blocked the plant from exporting to the united states . mr. nelson was even more critical of baxter international , which bought heparin ingredients from changzhou spl from 2004 through 2008 but did not inspect the facility until september 2007 . \\\\n the company sent one person who spent one day in the plant , mr. nelson said . five months later , the f.d.a. discovered myriad problems , he said . \\\\n “ it really is impossible for a plant to have fallen that far out of compliance in five months , ” mr. nelson said . \\\\n under withering questioning , dr. woodcock said that the f.d.a. would need another $ 225 million annually to inspect every foreign drug plant every other year , the frequency most say is needed . the agency will spend $ 11 million this year on foreign drug inspections . \\\\n there is a growing bipartisan consensus on capitol hill that the f.d.a. needs a rapid increase in its budget to ensure the safety of the nation ’s drugs , medical devices and food . \\\\n the bush administration has proposed increasing the agency ’s budget next year by only 3 percent to $ 1 . 8 billion , not enough to cover even its expected cost increases .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Heparin Contamination May Have Been Deliberate, F.D.A.

From 2004 to 2008, it sent only one person to the Changzhou plant for a one-day inspection in September 2007. It should have exercised more due diligence in ensuring the quality and safety of the raw materials it purchased.\\n    - **Scientific Protein Laboratories**: SPL, which supplied the heparin material to Baxter, also had responsibility. The Changzhou SPL company, a subsidiary of SPL, was the source of the contaminated heparin. SPL should have better managed its Chinese subsidiary and ensured the quality of the raw materials produced.\\n- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA made mistakes in its oversight.
