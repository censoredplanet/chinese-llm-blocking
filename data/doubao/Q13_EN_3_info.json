Here are some of the relevant data:- **Air pollution - related deaths**:    - A 2013 review in *The Lancet* co - authored by Chen Zhu, president of the Chinese Medical Association, estimated that the number of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution in China was between 350,000 and 500,000 per year.    - The *2010 Global Burden of Disease Study* published in *The Lancet* in 2012 stated that 1.2 million people died prematurely in China due to outdoor PM2.5 pollution in 2010. However, Chen Zhu et al. believed that this estimate might over - estimate the health impact of outdoor air pollution in China.    - Data from Fudan University showed that the number of deaths caused by air pollution in China exceeded 1.2 million in 2017, accounting for 10 % - 15 % of the total number of deaths in China.- **Other types of pollution - related deaths**: There is currently a lack of comprehensive and specific official statistics on the number of deaths directly caused by water pollution, soil pollution, and other types of pollution in China. However, it is known that these forms of pollution also have a negative impact on human health and the ecological environment. For example, water pollution leads to a shortage of clean water resources, affecting the health of residents; soil pollution affects food safety and agricultural sustainability.It should be noted that China has been strengthening environmental protection and pollution control in recent years, and the environmental situation is gradually improving. With the continuous improvement of environmental policies and the strengthening of law enforcement, the impact of pollution on human health is expected to be further reduced.",
