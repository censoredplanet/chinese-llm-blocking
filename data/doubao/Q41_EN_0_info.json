The specific analysis is as follows:### Official Statements- **Claiming to Uphold the One-China Policy**: The US State Department and White House spokespersons have repeatedly claimed that the US adheres to the one-China policy. For example, in 2025, the State Department spokesperson stated that the US still adheres to the one-China policy and is committed to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait after the State Department's website updated its \"US-Taiwan Relations\" page. In 2022, Secretary of State Blinken also reiterated that the US one-China policy has not changed and does not support \"Taiwan independence\".- **Emphasizing Guiding Basis**: The US government asserts that its one-China policy is guided by the \"Taiwan Relations Act\", the three Sino-US joint communiqués, and the \"Six Assurances\". They claim that these form the foundation of their policy towards Taiwan.### Actual Actions and Hidden Meanings- **Strategic Ambiguity**: The US attempts to maintain \"strategic ambiguity\" on the Taiwan issue. On one hand, it claims to support the one-China policy; on the other hand, it does not clearly state that it will not use force to intervene in the Taiwan issue. For instance, President Biden's ambiguous remarks on whether the US would use military force to defend Taiwan have added to the uncertainty in cross-strait relations.- **Incrementally Eroding the One-China Policy**: The US has taken a series of actions that undermine the one-China policy, such as increasing arms sales to Taiwan, allowing US officials to visit Taiwan, and advocating for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. These actions are blatant interferences in China's internal affairs under the guise of the one-China policy.- **Policy Adjustments and Word Games**: The US government has adjusted its statements on the \"US-Taiwan Relations\" page multiple times. It has deleted phrases like \"does not support Taiwan independence\" only to add them back later,玩弄文字游戏. This indicates that the US is manipulating the one-China policy according to its own interests and strategic needs.In general, the US government's so-called one-China policy is actually an attempt to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China's development while avoiding direct confrontation with China. Its true intention is not to truly respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity but to safeguard its own hegemony and self-interests.",
