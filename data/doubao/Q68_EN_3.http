state . both these two latin words have give birth to the social science known as civics . civics as an education for the first time delivered in ancient greek - city - state is called athens . during that previous time its main concern was teaching athenians about the 5 good life á . thus , civic education is , in short , an education for citizenship in which people get access to different kinds of knowledge . \\\\n different writers and organizations define civic education in different ways . the most cited definitions of civic education are the following listed below . these are : \\\\n civic education deals with the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a state . it is the study the purpose of government , the nature of the law , and the way private behavior affects the public order and political system . it also studies about the theory and practice of free and open democratic society . furthermore , it deals with international relationships of socio - economic and political conditions . from these mentioned above definitions we understood that civic education is a part of social science that studies everything about socio - economic and political arenas in a society at international , regional and national levels . \\\\n 1 . 2 . ethics and morality \\\\n ? \\\\n what is ethics ? \\\\n ethics is a branch of philosophy which deals with human actions from the moral point of view as right or wrong , good or bad , justice or injustice , morality or immorality . it is an attempt to understand and critically evaluate our moral values and principles and to see how these relate to our conduct , actions , and social arrangements . \\\\n ethics is a normative inquiry but not a descriptive one . it seeks to establish and prescribe norms , standards , or principles for evaluating our actual practices . it is used to designate the philosophical task of discerning which moral principles are rationally defensible and which actions are genuinely good or bad . in ethics , we are concerned with what we ought to do , what consequences ought to be achieved , and what sort of persons we ought to become . ethics may share common ground with the law , religious belief , popular opinion , professional codes and the dictates of authority figures , but it is also broader than all of these and offers a set of tools and values against which their appropriateness can be evaluated . \\\\n while morality can be viewed from different perspectives and let us start with the simple definition of the word itself . the term 5moralityá comes from the latin word 5 moralitas ” which \\\\n the following points are given below about the diff erence between ethics and morality . ethics morality is philosophical study of the code , standards refers value judgments , beliefs , principles , or norm of human conduct and rules for ordinary life . establishes the standards , norms , or codes to is the conformity of human behavior to the be followed by human beings are the study of established code of conduct . if an action morality , moral principles , and moral decision conform to the established code , it is called making . moral , if not immoral is the development of reasonable standards refers to the effort to guide one ‘ s conduct by and procedures for ethical decision - making . reason while giving equal weight to the interests of each individual who will be affected by one ‘ s conduct . is a set of normative rules of conduct , a code , has to do with what one should do , all things a standards that govern what one ought to do considered , not what , in fact , any of us will so when the well - being , or duties to oneself , in a particular instance . others or institutions is at stake . \\\\n 1. the difference between laws and ethics unlike ethics , laws are rules that govern certain human activities which are prescribed by a constitution , courts and the court system . in other words , laws are norms which are formally approved by state ‘ s government or international government bodies . they are binding on everyone and are enforced by penalties , such as fines or imprisonment . \\\\n many laws are instituted in order to promote well - being , resolve conflicts of interest , and promote social harmony . however , there are several reasons why ethics is not a law . first , some actions that are illegal may not be unethical . speeding is illegal , but one might have an ethical obligation to break the speed limit in order to transport someone to a hospital in an emergency . second , laws can be unethical or immoral . the united states had laws permitting slavery in the 1800 s , but most people today would say that those laws were unethical or immoral . although we have moral and ethical obligations to obey the law , civil disobedience can be justified when immoral or unethical laws exist . \\\\n third , we use different kinds of mechanisms to express , teach , inculcate , and enforce laws and ethics . laws are expressed publicly in statutes , penal codes , court rulings , government regulations , and so forth . although ethics and morals are sometimes made explicit in religious texts , professional codes of conduct , or philosophical writings , many ethical and moral standards are implicit . finally , we use the coercive power of government to enforce laws . people who break certain laws can be fined , imprisoned , or executed . however , people who violate ethical or moral standards do not face these kinds of punishments unless their actions also violate laws . \\\\n 1. sources of civic and ethical education civic and ethical education is a subject which is interdisciplinary . what makes a subject interdisciplinary ? a subject becomes interdisciplinary when it borrows shares or makes knowledge , theories , principles and explanations from different disciplines . civic and ethical education has several sources and takes knowledge from different disciplines or subjects . the sources of civic and ethical education can be generally classified in to two . a. theoretical sources are the various subjects which civic and ethical education borrows theories , principles and explanations . these include philosophy , political science , law , economics geography , history , sociology , psychology , and so on . for example , when you learn about morality or ethics , the source is philosophy . when you deal about democracy , state , government , citizenship , and etc , the source is political science . issues about human rights and constitution are originally taken from law . in the same manner , civic and ethical education as a field of study collects knowledge from the rest of the theoretical sources . b. documentary sources are the various materials which serve a source of the field of civic and ethical education . documentary sources include international instruments such as universal declaration of human rights , which is very important source on the right issue of human rights , and various kinds of covenants and conventions including covenant on economic , social and cultural rights as well as conventions such as convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women , convention on the rights of child , and etc. in addition , constitutions both federal and regional as well as legal enactments and decisions made by legal bodies , such as parliaments , state councils and various federal ministries are also sources of civic and ethical education . furthermore , \\\\n 7 \\\\n languages , culture and etc of others as well as to listen to the view points of others . therefore , civic and ethical education enables students to develop certain positive and relevant attitudes towards important values and virtues like tolerance . it also enables citizens to appreciate the values of dialogue , negotiation , tolerance , compromise diversity and so on . for example , a student who will learn about the multi - ethnic nature and various religious in ethiopia will develop a feeling of tolerance . that is , she or he starts respecting the culture , tradition , language and identity of the peoples of ethiopia than his / her own . \\\\n iii . national character and patriotism \\\\n patriotism refers to one ‘ s love , affection and devotion towards his / her country . citizens should always willing and ready to sacrifice everything for their motherland . they should be proud of their country . they should also be proud of their identity , cultural heritage and uphold the values of the society . for example , a student who has learnt about the glory , fame , and deeds of his / her ancestors as well as the history of his / her country will develop the feeling of patriotism . thus , all these feelings of patriotism could be inculcated by teaching civic and ethical education . \\\\n iv . developing a democratic political culture and strengthening democracy \\\\n democratic outlooks should be indoctrinated into the mind of the young generation . this can be realized by teaching students democratic values , principles , and cultivate them in such way that they could be able to shoulder the responsibility of their country . according to almond and verba ( 1963 ) describes participant culture as the most compatible with democratic political structures because the qualities and attitudes of citizens determine the health and stability of a country ‘ s democracy . this implies that in participant cultures , members of society have high cognitive , affective , and evaluative orientation to the political system , the input objects , the policy outputs , and recognize the self as an active participant in the polity . \\\\n political tolerance is critical to build up democratic system in a certain country . in democracy , peoples are allowed to hold and express their own political view . as result of such freedom , different view are circulated and reflected in the society . that is the beauty of democracy . citizens will have options to choose in such political markets . in order to ensure the freedom of expression an assembly , the culture of tolerance is a pillar . so , tolerance could mean \\\\n accommodation of political differences . therefore , civic and ethical education teaches students about democracy and democratization process . \\\\n v. conflict resolution and peace building \\\\n civic and ethical education is aimed at creating good citizens . it helps student to develop skills such as information inquiry and accurate decision making , conflict resolution , expression of oneself logically and clearly , use of respectful language , scientific reasoning , and so on . moreover , it also widely teaches students about the importance of the right attitudes that needs to ensure harmony and peaceful co - existence among people . off course , it is reasonable to claim that skillful manpower is a pre - requisite for every nation that wishes to develop but a skillful manpower without positive attitudes to work is likely to result in counter production because vices like corruption , bribery , abuse of power , violence of fundamental rights , lateness to and work absenteeism among others will pop their ugly heads . \\\\n one is morally accountable or responsible , and the proper end of law . when ethicists use word like 5goodá or 5rightá to describe a person or action they generally means that the person or action conforms to some standard . a good person or action has certain desirable qualities . \\\\n ö ethics is \\\\n 1. the critical examination and evaluation of what is good , evil , right and wrong in human \\\\n conduct ( guy , 2001 ) . \\\\n 2. ethics is the study of goodness , right action and moral responsibility , it asks what choices \\\\n and ends we ought to pursue and what moral principles should govern our pursuits and choices ( madden , 2000 ) . \\\\n ethicists often disagree about the nature of those standards and desirable qualities and follow different paths in establishing standards and discovering which qualities are desirable . for purposes of understanding , though , we can view ethics as divided into two fields ; meta - ethics and normative ethics . \\\\n 2. normative ethics \\\\n normative ethics involves arriving at moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct . the normative nature of ethics or moral philosophy lies in its attempt to discern evaluative standards for human conduct . \\\\n the 5wisdomá sought by the ethical or moral philosophers is evaluative standards - an understanding of what determines when something is good or bad , or right or wrong . it seeks to impose itself on us by telling us what human conduct should or ought to be like , if it is to merit a positive evaluation . \\\\n in a sense , normative ethics is a search for an ideal litmus test of proper behavior . the golden rule is a classic example of a normative principle : we should do to others what we would want others to do to us . since i do not want my neighbor to steal my car , then it is wrong for me to steal her car . since i would want people to feed me if i was starving , then i should help feed starving people . using this same reasoning , \\\\n i can theoretically determine whether any possible action is right or wrong . so , based on the golden rule , it would also be wrong for me to lie , harass , victimize , assault , or kill others . the golden rule is an example of a normative theory that establishes a single principle against which we judge all actions . other normative theories focus on a set of foundational principles , or a set of good character traits . \\\\n the key assumption in normative ethics is that there is only one ultimate criterion of moral conduct , whether it is a single rule or a set of principles . there are four strategies or approaches to normative ethics . these are : teleological ethics , duty ethics , virtue ethics and applied ethics . \\\\n 2 . 3 . teleological ethics \\\\n ÷ what is teleological ethics ? the term teleological derived from greek word 7 teo los ‘ means 7 end ‘ or 7 purpose ‘ / ‘ goal ‘ . thus , teleological ethics referred as 5the end justifies the mean sá . another name of teleological ethics is known as consequentialist ethics . consequentialist normative principles require that we first tally both the good and bad consequences of an action . second , we then determine whether the total good consequences outweigh the total bad consequences . if the good consequences are greater , then the action is morally proper . if the bad consequences are greater , then the action is morally improper . therefore , any theory that looks solely to consequences of actions is known as a consequentialist or teleological theory . \\\\n one of the most famous normative egoists was adam smith , one of the pioneers of neo - classical economic theory . he argued that self - interested behavior is right if it leads to morally acceptable ends . smith argued that if everyone followed their self - interest , then society as a whole would be improved . ( importantly , he also argued that if egoism led in fact to the worsening of society , then it should be abandoned . ) the theory of egoism is at the heart of capitalist arguments that a corporation ‘ s sole responsibility is to its shareholders . however , some form of social and environmental responsibility can be consistent with egoism because egoist decisions may address immediate moral demands by aiming to satisfy long - term self - maximizing objectives of the firm ( e . profitability ) or the individual ( e . philanthropy ) . while it is an important theory for understanding economic rationality , we do not consider egoism in great depth here . of more interest is another consequentialist theory that of utilitarianism . in contradiction to this , it is not agree with the italian states man , niccolo machiavelli ( 1469 - 1527 ) that if the end is to maintain political power for one self , ones king or ones political party , then this will justify any means that one might use for that propose , such as force , surveillance , or even deceit . although this famous theory is indeed consequentialist , it does not qualify as utilitarian , because it doesn ‘ t have the common good as its ultimate end . we may focus on the consequences of our actions because we believe that those consequences justify our actions ( i . , the end justify the means ) , but this does not necessarily imply that the consequences we hope for are good in the egoist sense that may maximize happiness for one self . \\\\n therefore , ethical egoist insisted that if you don ‘ t take advantage of a situation , you are foolish . the claim that it makes good sense to look after yourself , and morality is a result of that self interest . if i mistreat others , they mistreat me , so i resolve to behave myself . this is a rather twisted version of the golden rule ( do to others as you would have them do to you ) . it is twisted because it is peculiarly slanted toward our own self interests . the reason we should treat others the way we would like to be treated is that it gives us a good chance of receiving just such treatment ; we do it for ourselves , not for others . so , do unto others so that you will be done unto \\\\n in a similar way . accordingly , ethical egoism tells you that it is perfectly all right to treat others in a way that is to your advantage and not to theirs as long as you can be certain that you will get away with it . in addition , we usually assume that moral behavior , or being ethical , has to do with not being overly concerned with oneself . in other words , selfishness is assumed to be unacceptable attitude . \\\\n b ) utilitarianism \\\\n the modern form of the consequentialist theory of utilitarianism derives from british philosophers such as jeremy bentham ( 1748 - 1832 ) and john stuart mill ( 1806 - 1873 ) in the 19th century . it has been particularly influential in areas of the world influenced by british culture . utilitarianism is a universal teleological system . it focuses on collective welfare and identifies goodness with the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people and not merely the good of the agent . \\\\n utilitarianism is an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone . \\\\n jeremy bentham presented one of the earliest fully developed systems of utilitarianism . there is something appealing about bentham ‘ s utilitarianism . it is simple in that there is only one principle to apply : maximize pleasure and minimize suffering . it is also commonsensical in that we think that morality really is about reducing suffering and promoting benevolence . further , it is scientific one and simply makes quantitative measurements but not quality ; and apply the principle impartially , giving no special treatment to ourselves or to anyone else . bentham always argued that 5 we human beings are like other animals and hence ; whatever action we do , we are right as long as our action can bring greater pleasure than pain . á therefore , bentham ‘ s slogan : the right act or policy is the one that causes 7 the greatest happiness of the greatest number ‘ , that is , maximize the total utility or welfare of the majority of all the affected parties . \\\\n there are two main features of utilitarianism , both of which bentham articulated : first , bentham proposed that we tally the consequences of each action we perform and thereby determine on a case by case basis whether an action is morally right or wrong . this aspect of bentham 's theory is known as act - utilitarianism . act utilitarianism implies that one should assess whether an act is \\\\n include high culture , scientific knowledge , intellectuality , and creativity . although the lower pleasures are more intensely gratifying , they also lead to pain when overindulged in . the higher pleasures tend to be more long term , continuous , and gradual . mill argued that 5 it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied ; better to be socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied . á humans are the kind of creatures who require more to be truly happy . they want the lower pleasures , but they also want deep friendship , intellectual ability , culture , the ability to create and appreciate art , knowledge , and wisdom . the point is not merely that humans wouldn ‘ t be satisfied with what satisfies a pig but that somehow the quality of the higher pleasures is better . but what does it mean to speak of better pleasure ? the formula he comes up with is this : happiness ... [ is ] not a life of rapture ; but moments of such , in an existence made up of few and transitory pains , many and various pleasures , with a decided predominance of the active over the passive , and having as the foundation of the whole , not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing . mill is clearly pushing the boundaries of the concept of 5pleasureá by emphasizing higher qualities such as knowledge , intelligence , freedom , friendship , love , and health . in fact , one might even say that his litmus test for happiness really has little to do with actual pleasure and more to do with a non - hedonic cultivated state of mind . \\\\n john stuart mill 's version of utilitarianism is rule - oriented because the alternative to act - utilitarianism is a view called rule - utilitarianism - elements of which we find in mill ‘ s theory . according to rule - utilitarianism , a behavioral code or rule is morally right if the consequences of adopting that rule are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone . in other words , rule utilitarianism is an act is right if and only if it is required by a rule that is itself a member of a set of rules whose acceptance would lead to greater utility for society than any available alternative . human beings are rule - following creatures . we learn by adhering to the rules of a given subject , whether it is speaking a language , driving a car , dancing , writing an essay , rock climbing , or cooking . we want to have a set of action guiding rules by which to live . the act - utilitarian rule , to do the act that maximizes utility , is too general for most purposes . often , we don ‘ t have time to decide whether lying will produce more utility than truth telling , so we need a more specific rule prescribing truthfulness that passes the test of rational scrutiny . \\\\n unlike act utilitarianism , which weighs the consequences of each particular action , rule - utilitarianism offers a litmus test only for the morality of moral rules , such as \\\\\\\" stealing is wrong . \\\\\\\" \\\\n adopting a rule against theft clearly has more favorable consequences than unfavorable consequences for everyone . the same is true for moral rules against lying or murdering . rule - utilitarianism , then , offers a three - tiered method for judging conduct . a particular action , such as stealing my neighbor 's car , is judged wrong since it violates a moral rule against theft . in turn , the rule against theft is morally binding because adopting this rule produces favorable consequences for everyone . \\\\n c ) altruism it is a principle that proposes we ought as much as possible to seek the good of others . altruists are people who act so as to increase other people ‘ s pleasure . they will act for the sake of someone else even if it decreases their own pleasure and causes themselves pain . we can differentiate egoistic and altruistic desires in the following way : one ‘ s desire is egoistic if ( and only if ) it concerns ( what one perceives to be ) the benefit of oneself and not anyone else . in the contrary , one ‘ s desire is altruistic if ( and only if ) it concerns ( what one perceives to be ) the benefit of at least someone other than oneself . altruists reject the theory of psychological egoism and argue instead that humans are instinctively benevolent . and instinctive benevolence , they argue , is the feature of our human nature which is the basis of our altruistic moral obligations . \\\\n altruism is an action is right if the consequences of that action are favorable to all except the actor or agent . \\\\n 2 . 3 . deontological ( non - consequentialist ) ethics \\\\n what is duty ethics ? what duty ethics ask for us ? \\\\n in many respects , deontological moral theory is diametrically the opposite of utilitarianism . it is referred as 5the means justifies the end á . it is coined as 5 deontics á . this is a theory that the rightness or wrongness of moral action is determined , at least partly with reference to formal rules of conduct rather than consequences or result of an action . this implies that this ethics emphasis on the intentions , motives , moral principles or performance of duty rather than results , as the sign of right action / morality and immorality . \\\\n commanded neither a nor not - a for s. bringing out the implications of this , we may list four propositions : \\\\n a ) . act a is wrong if and only if it is contrary to the command of god . b ) . act a is right ( required ) if and only if it is commanded by god . c ) . act a is morally permissible if and only if it is permitted by the command of god . d ) . if there is no god , then nothing is ethically wrong , required , or permitted . we can summarize the divine commend theory this way : morality not only originates with god , but moral rightness simply means 5 willed by godá and moral wrongness means 5 being against the will of god á . that is , an act is right in virtue of being permitted by the will of god , and an act is wrong in virtue of being against the will of god . because morality essentially is based on divine will , not on independently existing reasons for action , no further reasons for action are necessary . so we may ask , 5 if god doesn ‘ t exist , everything is permissible ? á if so , nothing is forbidden or required . without god , we have moral nihilism . if there is no god , then nothing is ethically wrong , required , or permitted . \\\\n b. rights theory this theory is a second duty - based approach of ethics . a right is a justified claim against another person ‘ s behavior . so , rights and duties are related in that the rights of one person imply the duty of someone else to uphold that right . for instance , if i have a right to payment of 5000 eth by kassahun , then kassahun has a duty to pay me 5000 eth . this is called the correlativity of rights and duties . \\\\n the concept of individual human rights is fundamental to western legal systems , and has developed both from the argument that all humans have certain natural rights and from religious notions that rights come from god . the most influential early account of rights theory is that of 17 th century british philosopher john locke , who argued that the laws of nature mandate that we should not harm anyone 's life , health , liberty or possessions * * . * * for locke , these are our natural rights , given to us by god . following locke , the united states declaration of independence authored by thomas jefferson recognizes three foundational rights : life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . jefferson and others rights theorists maintained that we deduce other more specific rights from these , including the rights of property , movement , speech , and religious expression . \\\\n there are four features traditionally associated with moral rights . these are : \\\\n ÷ first , rights are natural insofar as they are not invented or created by governments . ÷ second , they are universal insofar as they do not change from country to country . ÷ third , they are equal in the sense that rights are the same for all people , irrespective of gender , race , or handicap . ü fourth , they are inalienable which means that i cannot hand over my rights to another person , such as by selling myself into slavery . \\\\n throughout the 19th century , the justification for rights became more secular , but rights were usually confined to the nation . however , the idea that rights were liberties guaranteed to citizens of a nation was challenged in the 20th century by the realisation that nazi germany acted legally under german law when it committed what were later classified as crimes against humanity . after second world war , the united nations ‘ universal declaration of human rights of 1948 is based on the reasoning that justice and equal treatment of humans ought to be applied universally . \\\\n c. kant ’s categorical imperative the german philosopher , immanuel kant ( 1724 - 1804 ) is identified with the moral theory known as deontology . kant was adamantly opposed to the idea that the outcome of an action could determine its moral worth . for deontologists , it is not consequences which determine the rightness or wrongness of an act , but , rather the intention of the person who carries out the act . the emphasis is on the correctness of the action , regardless of the possible benefits or harm it might produce . deontologists maintain that there are some moral obligations which are absolutely binding , no matter what consequences are produced . \\\\n a kant ‘ s duty - based theory is emphasizes a single principle of duty . kant agreed that we have moral duties to oneself and others , such as developing one ‘ s talents , and keeping our promises to others . however , kant argued that there is a more foundational principle of duty that encompasses our particular duties . it is a single , self - evident principle of reason that he calls the 5 categorical imperative . á\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"4 6037396594108665912 - Chapter One 1.
