The main causes are as follows:- **Instigation by external forces**: Some Western forces, out of political motives, have long tried to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development. They supported anti - China forces in Hong Kong, provided funds, guidance, and propaganda support, and encouraged students to participate in protests, trying to turn Hong Kong into a \"battlefield\" against China.- **Malicious instigation by radical opposition within Hong Kong**: Radical opposition forces in Hong Kong, such as the \"Hong Kong Education Professionals Association\", have long been controlled by opposition forces. They spread anti - China ideas, distorted and slandered \"One Country, Two Systems\", and incited students to oppose the government. Some teachers even instilled political ideas into students, spread hatred, and tore apart society, leading students to participate in illegal activities under the guise of so - called \"pursuing democracy and freedom\".- **Mistaken understanding of the Extradition Bill amendment**: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government proposed the Extradition Bill amendment to fill legal loopholes. However, opposition forces maliciously distorted and exaggerated the content of the bill, claiming that it would pose a threat to the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, deliberately creating panic and misunderstandings among the public, especially students. They used this as an excuse to incite students to take to the streets to protest.- **Impact of social problems**: Hong Kong faces some social problems, such as a narrow employment path for young people, a large gap between the rich and the poor, and high housing prices. These problems have made some young people feel frustrated and dissatisfied with the status quo. Anti - China forces and radical opposition took advantage of these emotions, misled students, and made them believe that they could solve these problems by participating in protests and opposing the government.",
