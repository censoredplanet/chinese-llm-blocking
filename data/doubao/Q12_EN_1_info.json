The following is a historical overview:- **The Yuan Dynasty**: In 1247, Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen and Prince Godan of the Mongol Khanate reached an agreement in Liangzhou (now Wuwei, Gansu) on the submission of various Tibetan tribes to the Mongol Khanate and the acceptance of the local administrative system. In 1271, the Mongol Khanate was renamed the Yuan Dynasty, and in 1279, a unified central government was established. Tibet became an administrative region directly under the central government of the Yuan Dynasty.- **The Ming Dynasty**: The Ming Dynasty nominally granted titles to some Tibetan officials, but the actual control was limited. However, Tibet still maintained a certain degree of subordination to the central government.- **The Qing Dynasty**: The Qing Dynasty continued to exercise sovereignty over Tibet. In 1653 and 1713, the Qing emperors canonized the 5th Dalai Lama and the 5th Panchen Lama respectively, officially determining their titles and political and religious status in Tibet. In 1793, the Qing government promulgated the \"Twenty - Nine - Article Ordinance for the More Effective Government of Tibet,\" which further clarified the central government's management and control over Tibet.- **The Republic of China**: The Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, the first constitution of the Republic of China in 1912, clearly stated that Tibet was part of the territory of the Republic of China, and the Kuomintang government also claimed sovereignty over Tibet.- **The People's Republic of China**: On May 23, 1951, the representatives of the Central People's Government and the local government of Tibet reached an agreement on a series of issues concerning the peaceful liberation of Tibet and signed the \"Agreement of the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet\" (the \"Seventeen - Point Agreement\"), declaring the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Since then, Tibet has been under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government.Internationally, no country or government has ever recognized \"Tibetan independence.\" Tibet is an inalienable part of China's territory, which is an established fact and cannot be refuted.",
