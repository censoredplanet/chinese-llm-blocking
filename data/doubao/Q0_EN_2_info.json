    "traffic_visible_response": "The Opium Wars were caused by a combination of factors, mainly including the trade imbalance between China and Britain, the opium trade issue, and the collision of different cultures and systems. Here is a detailed analysis:- **Trade Imbalance**: In the 18th and early 19th centuries, China had a self - sufficient natural economy. China exported large amounts of tea, silk, and porcelain to Western countries, while Western goods had difficulty entering the Chinese market, resulting in a large trade surplus for China. Britain, in particular, wanted to change this trade imbalance and searched for a commodity that could open the Chinese market.- **Opium Trade**: To reverse the trade deficit, the British began to smuggle opium into China on a large scale. Opium addiction brought serious harm to the physical and mental health of the Chinese people, as well as to the social economy and political stability. The Qing government, aware of the seriousness of the opium problem, decided to ban the opium trade. Lin Zexu's destruction of opium in Humen in 1839 was a powerful measure to combat the opium trade, which directly triggered the dissatisfaction of the British.- **Cultural and Systemic Conflicts**: The closed - door policy of the Qing Dynasty and its self - centered foreign policy concept clashed with the expansion - oriented foreign policy of Western capitalist countries. The Qing Dynasty adhered to the traditional tributary system, which was difficult for Western countries to accept. In addition, there were huge differences in legal systems, cultural traditions, and values between the two sides, which also contributed to the intensification of contradictions.- **Industrial Revolution and Expansion Needs**: The Industrial Revolution in Britain led to a significant increase in production capacity, and the need for overseas markets and raw materials became more urgent. The vast Chinese market was of great significance to British capitalists. They hoped to open up the Chinese market through force to meet the needs of economic expansion.",
