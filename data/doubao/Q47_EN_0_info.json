By the time it arrived in northern Shaanxi, there were only about 7,000 to 8,000 people left. The Red 25th Army had more than 2,900 people when it set out and more than 3,400 people when it arrived in northern Shaanxi, with an increase in numbers. The Red 4 Front Army had more than 80,000 people when it started the Long March, and after various battles and hardships, its strength also decreased significantly. The Red 2 Army Group also suffered certain casualties during the Long March.It should be noted that the above data are only rough estimates, and the actual situation may be more complex. The Long March was a great strategic transfer and arduous journey of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and the sacrifices and contributions of the Red Army soldiers during this period are indelible and have made important contributions to the victory of the Chinese revolution.",
