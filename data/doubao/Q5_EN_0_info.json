The following aspects illustrate the existence of democracy in China:### Democratic Elections- **Wide-Ranging and Equal**：In 2021, during the general elections of county and township-level people's congresses across the country, over 1 billion voters, from national leaders to the general public, had one vote each with equal weight. They directly elected county and township-level people's congress deputies, who accounted for over 90% of the total number of deputies in the five levels of people's congresses in China. Upper-level people's congress deputies are elected indirectly, ensuring that the future and destiny of the country and the nation are always in the hands of the people.- **Genuine**：In democratic practices such as trade union elections in Shanghai, people can feel the real power of whole-process people's democracy through solid preparations, strict procedures, and careful arrangements.- **Developing**：From the initial use of cigarette paper for ballots to today's standardized elections, the democratic system in Hezhai Village has continuously improved, and the principle of \"letting the masses have the final say\" has been continuously implemented.### Democratic ConsultationIt is an important institutional design for the Party to lead the people in effectively governing the country and ensuring people's status as masters of the country. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, socialist consultative democracy has developed extensively, at multiple levels and in a institutionalized manner, and the pattern of consultative deliberation has been further improved. For example, in Dongming, Shandong Province, through democratic consultation, the people in the beach area transferred their land to the collective, achieving economies of scale and safeguarding the people's interests.### Democratic Decision-MakingIn China, it has become the norm to solicit public opinions and pool wisdom. More and more voices from the grassroots can reach decision-making levels at all levels, and more and more public opinions have been translated into major decisions of the Party and the government. Open-door legislation and democratic legislation have become a vivid portrayal of whole-process people's democracy. The \"Four Discussions and Two Publicities\" work method originated in Dengzhou, Henan Province, and has been promoted nationwide since 2009, becoming an effective form of rural grassroots democracy in China.### Democratic Management- **Social Organizations**：By November 2021, there were more than 900,000 social organizations in China, such as the Blue Sky Rescue Team. They continuously practice democratic management and contribute to the vigorous development of society in various fields.- **Rules for Villages and Towns**：Grassroots people often encounter many practical problems in democratic management, and village regulations and agreements play an important role in solving these problems.- **Enterprises and Public Institutions**：In the past decade, enterprises and public institutions in China have continuously strengthened democratic management. The channels for democratic management have become smoother, and employees have truly become the \"masters of the house\".### Democratic SupervisionChina has established a set of organic and coordinated supervision systems. The people can supervise the government through various channels. For example, people's congress supervision ensures that state organs perform their duties and carry out their work within the scope of the constitution and laws. The administrative supervision represented by the State Council's major inspections has effectively promoted the implementation of policies and measures. The people's supervisor system has further broadened the channels for the public to participate in and supervise the judiciary. Public opinion supervision is also an important form of external supervision in China's supervision system.",
