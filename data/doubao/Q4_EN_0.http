off , with protesters hurling homemade bombs and the police gunning them down in the streets . \\\\n today , a stilted calm prevails , a cover - up so carefully planned that the small town looks like a relic from the cultural revolution , as if the government had decided to re - educate the entire population . \\\\n banners hang everywhere , with slogans in big red characters proclaiming things like \\\\\\\" stability is paramount \\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"don't trust instigators . \\\\\\\" \\\\n many facts remain unclear about the police crackdown on a dongzhou demonstration on dec. 6 , which residents say ended in the deaths of 20 or more , but one thing seems certain : the government is doing everything possible to prevent eyewitness accounts of what happened from emerging . \\\\n residents of dongzhou , a small town now cordoned off by heavy police roadblocks and patrols , said in scores of interviews on the telephone and with visitors that they had endured beatings , bribes and threats at the hands of the security forces since their protest against the construction of a power plant was violently put down . others said corpses had been withheld , ostensibly because they were so riddled with bullets that they would contradict the government 's version of events . \\\\n and residents have been warned that if they must explain the deaths of loved ones - many of whom were killed during a tense standoff in which fireworks , blasting caps and crude gasoline bombs were thrown by the villagers - they should simply say their relatives were blown up by their own explosives . \\\\n \\\\\\\" local officials are talking to families that had relatives killed in the incident , telling them that if they tell higher officials and outsiders that they died by accident , by explosives , while confronting the police , they must make it sound convincing , \\\\\\\" one resident of the besieged town said in an interview . \\\\\\\" if the family members speak this way , they are being promised 50,000 yuan and if not , they will be beaten and get nothing out of it . \\\\\\\" ( the 50,000 yuan equals $ 6 , 194 . ) \\\\n another villager , who , like other residents , spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals , said families of the dead that agreed to invoke accidental explosion as the cause of death had been offered about 120,000 yuan each . \\\\n \\\\\\\" the story is being spread around the village that people were not killed by bullets , but by bombs , \\\\\\\" said one man interviewed friday by telephone . \\\\\\\"that 's rubbish . everybody knows they were killed by gunfire . \\\\\\\" \\\\n the bomb story was also being repeated at a hospital in the nearby city of shanwei , where villagers wounded in the protest were still being treated . plainclothes police officers immediately surrounded a chinese man who entered the hospital seeking to see the wounded , denying him access to a tightly guarded ward even when he said that his relative was among those hurt . later , hospital staff members told the man that the wounded had all been warned to repeat the same story , of being hurt by their own explosives . \\\\n the attempt to enforce a concocted story may help explain why residents have reported difficulty recovering the bodies of victims . \\\\n the official xinhua press agency said saturday that only three people had been killed and eight others wounded when security forces shot at protesters , so the existence of more bodies with gunshot wounds could destroy the official version of events and provide proof of overwhelming force against a lightly armed , if restive , crowd . \\\\n \\\\\\\" the relatives went in tears to the county offices to search for the dead and missing , and they were beaten by electric truncheon , wounded and dispersed , \\\\\\\" one resident said . \\\\n \\\\\\\" they offered 50,000 yuan , and told us we could only get back the body at night and bury it on the mountain immediately , without any mourning ceremony or fireworks , without anyone knowing about this , \\\\\\\" a relative of wei jin , a man killed during the demonstration , said in an account of an attempted bribe involving his relative 's corpse . \\\\\\\" and if someone from outside asks about the issue , we must say he died by his own bomb . we turned down the offer , and they doubled the money , but we still would not accept it . \\\\\\\" \\\\n the man said his relative had been shot twice , once from afar and again from close range . \\\\n other residents of dongzhou buried their relatives in secret so that the government would not take the bodies . \\\\n \\\\\\\" we buried the body on the 7th by ourselves , and would not let them know where it is , \\\\\\\" said a relative of lin yidu i , who was one of the dead . \\\\\\\" you should let the dead lie in peace . \\\\\\\" \\\\n more than half of the scores of people reached by telephone in recent days said they were too frightened to share their experiences by phone , and many of them hung up hastily . \\\\n 3 killed villagers are named \\\\n the chinese state media on sunday published the names of three villagers killed by the police during protests in dongzhou , the associated press reported from beijing . the guangzhou daily identified the three men as lin yidu i , 26 ; jiang guang ge , 35 ; and wei jin , 31.\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"China tries to keep witnesses to deadly protest quiet -

party independent investigation is called for in order to establish the basic knowledge about the facts of the dongzhou incident , and thereby push for a fair solution within the legal framework . recently , with the assistance of some civil rights volunteers , we were able to conduct an independent investigation at the scene . \\\\n ( dongzhou street and dongzhou hang village . \\\\n the coal -

riot police officers equipped with armored police vehicles , fire engines , machine guns , sub - machine guns and flamethrowers began to get into formation about 100 meters in front of the road blocks set up by the villagers . \\\\n around 7 pm , the police began to fire many tear gas canisters at the villagers and they pushed forward slowly . during the action , some villagers were hit by rubber bullets . when the villagers could not resist the gas , they retreated but they would move back up to the road block after the tear gas was dispersed . this sequence of events repeated itself several times . \\\\n from about 830 pm to 900 pm , the police who were 50 meters away began to use machine guns and sub - machine guns to spray the villagers who were illuminated by searchlights . it is impossible to verify if there was any warning , since the villagers were inexperienced and there was smoke and gas everywhere at the scene . since the villagers never expected the police to shoot , those who did not take evasive actions paid the price . most of the casualties occurred during this period . afterwards , there was a period during which the police did not attack any further . some villagers claimed that the police were disposing of the bodies , but this cannot be verified now . \\\\n the villagers facing the police at the scene did not learn until after 10pm that some villagers had been shot and died at the hospital . then and only then they realized that shooting had taken place . afterwards , to avoid more casualties , the villagers retreated inside the village . for the first time , the police went past the roadblock and then slowly progressed in several directions ( towards the dongzhou street police station , the wind power plant and the coal power plant ) and they fired at the brushes on both sides of the road with guns and flamethrowers in case villagers were hiding there . they demolished and burned down the tents and signs set up by the villagers at many intersections ( including at the power plants ) . at the same time , the fire engines washed away the blood at the scene . the sound of gunfire did not stop until midnight . \\\\n from december 7 , the armed police surrounded and locked down dongzhou street and dongzhou hang village . they forbade the villagers to go out and look for their missing relatives or to hold memorial services for the dead . they cut off communications with the outside . they used their propaganda tools to say that the government did the right thing and placed the blame on the villagers representatives and the participants . from december 9 , they began to arrest the village representatives and other active participants . \\\\n according to the dongzhou villagers : as of now , it is known that three families have received sums of money for their deceased relatives in the name of aid ( but not compensation ) ; eight injured persons were treated , but the families are forbidden to look after or visit the wounded at the hospital , possibly to prevent the families from exchanging information with them ; the injured have received no compensation ; more than 30 villagers are still missing , and the villagers are worried that their bodies had been destroyed without a trace ; more than 10 villagers have been arrested and held at unknown locations , without any legal explanation to their families . some villagers claimed that the arrestees have been tortured . some villagers have fled to the outside . \\\\n ( the intersection at which the shooting took place ) \\\\n ( the intersection at which the shooting took place . \\\\n the top right corner shows dongzhou street and dongzhou hang village ) \\\\n ( the intersection of the shooting . \\\\n the top left corner shows the coal -

powered plant at shigong liao and the construction site of the coal - powered plant at dongzhou were not attacked or damaged as indicated in the official reports . \\\\n 2. although there were numerous people on both sides when the incident took place , they were distinctly segregated and kept a distance away from each other . there was no cause for confusion . \\\\n 3. when the incident occurred , the dongzhou villagers were in a completely passive situation . there was no way for them to effectively attack the police or cause critical and major damages , and there were no signs of any such effort . \\\\n 4. the shooting began not as a misjudgment at the scene , but the police actively and deliberately caused it . \\\\n 5. the number of civilian casualties in the dongzhou incident is undetermined and unverified as yet . \\\\n 6. from the fact that armed police officers were mobilized to the cover - up activities after the police shot the villagers , this whole action showed that it was planned , organized and deliberate . the shooting must have been approved beforehand by the superiors as an acceptable action if the villagers refused to retreat . \\\\n 7. from the signs before and after the incident , and from our understanding about how the military police would use firearms only if they have the approval from superiors , the order to shoot definitely did not come from the police commander at the scene or even a shanwei city official .\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"EastSouthWestNorth: The GMRQ Investigative Report of the Shanwei (Dongzhou) Incident\\\",\\\"sitename\\\":\\\"zonaeuropa.com\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20060112_1.htm\\\",\\\"doc_id\\\":\\\"397ec3f938bd9ce1-8aac6d2fc559733a\\\",\\\"original_doc_rank\\\":2}},{\\\"text_card\\\":{\\\"summary\\\":\\\"chinese pressing to keep village silent on clash \\\\n shanghai , dec. 16 -

The following is a detailed account:\\n1. **Protest Origins**: The government planned to partially fill the bay in Dongzhou, Shanwei, Guangdong, and build a power plant. Local farmers were dissatisfied as they received insufficient compensation for the expropriated land. Fishermen were worried that their livelihoods would be affected, and residents were also concerned about potential pollution to crops from the power plant.\\n2. **December 6, 2005 Incidents**:\\n    - **Afternoon**: On December 6, 2005, hundreds of villagers from nearby Shigongliao Village protested in front of the wind-powered plant over land requisition issues, and dozens of Dongzhou villagers went to support. The police arrested two Dongzhou villagers.\\n    - **4 PM**: To prevent the police from taking away the arrested villagers and to fend off possible police attacks on the village, the villagers set up roadblocks at intersections on Dongzhou Street. About 2,000 to 3,000 villagers gathered, some carrying sticks, poles, fishing forks, and a few having fishing detonators and fireworks, but most were unarmed.\\n    - **5 PM**: Around 1,500 armed police and anti-riot police equipped with armored vehicles, fire engines, machine guns, submachine guns, and flamethrowers formed up 100 meters in front of the roadblocks.\\n    - **7 PM**: The police fired tear gas canisters at the villagers and advanced slowly. Some villagers were hit by rubber bullets. The villagers retreated when affected by the gas and returned after it dispersed, and this happened several times.\\n    - **8:30 - 9 PM**: The police 50 meters away began firing machine guns and submachine guns at the villagers illuminated by searchlights. Many casualties occurred during this period.\\n    - **After 10 PM**: The villagers at the scene learned that some villagers had been shot and died in the hospital. They then retreated into the village.

The following is a detailed account:\\n1. **Protest Origins**: The government planned to partially fill the bay in Dongzhou, Shanwei, Guangdong, and build a power plant. Local farmers were dissatisfied as they received insufficient compensation for the expropriated land. Fishermen were worried that their livelihoods would be affected, and residents were also concerned about potential pollution to crops from the power plant.\\n2. **December 6, 2005 Incidents**:\\n    - **Afternoon**: On December 6, 2005, hundreds of villagers from nearby Shigongliao Village protested in front of the wind-powered plant over land requisition issues, and dozens of Dongzhou villagers went to support. The police arrested two Dongzhou villagers.\\n    - **4 PM**: To prevent the police from taking away the arrested villagers and to fend off possible police attacks on the village, the villagers set up roadblocks at intersections on Dongzhou Street. About 2,000 to 3,000 villagers gathered, some carrying sticks, poles, fishing forks, and a few having fishing detonators and fireworks, but most were unarmed.\\n    - **5 PM**: Around 1,500 armed police and anti-riot police equipped with armored vehicles, fire engines, machine guns, submachine guns, and flamethrowers formed up 100 meters in front of the roadblocks.\\n    - **7 PM**: The police fired tear gas canisters at the villagers and advanced slowly. Some villagers were hit by rubber bullets. The villagers retreated when affected by the gas and returned after it dispersed, and this happened several times.\\n    - **8:30 - 9 PM**: The police 50 meters away began firing machine guns and submachine guns at the villagers illuminated by searchlights. Many casualties occurred during this period.\\n    - **After 10 PM**: The villagers at the scene learned that some villagers had been shot and died in the hospital. They then retreated into the village. The police advanced past the roadblocks, fired guns and used flamethrowers on the bushes on both sides of the road, demolished and burned the villagers' tents and signs, and the fire engines washed away the blood at the scene. The gunfire did not stop until midnight.\\n3. **Aftermath**:\\n    - **December 7 Onwards**: The armed police surrounded and blockaded Dongzhou Street and Dongzhouhang Village, prohibiting villagers from going out to search for missing relatives or hold memorial services for the dead, and cutting off communications.\\n    - **December 11, 2005**: The Chinese government announced that a police commander was detained for mishandling the protest and causing deaths and injuries.\\n    - **June 2006**: The New York Times reported that 19 residents had been prosecuted for the unrest, and 7 were given long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the police.\\n\\nThe official Xinhua News Agency reported that 3 people were killed and 8 were injured, but some residents claimed that as many as 20 people had died.\\n\\n\"}","event_id":"96","event_type":2001}
