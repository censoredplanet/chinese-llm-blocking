For example, the Mid - Autumn Festival is a time when families gather to give thanks for the harvest and the reunion of loved ones. The Double Ninth Festival also contains the meaning of showing respect and gratitude to the elderly. Additionally, Chinese New Year is a grand occasion for people to express gratitude for the past year and look forward to a better future.In recent years, there has also been an increasing emphasis on cultivating a spirit of gratitude in society, and some schools and organizations may carry out activities to promote gratitude education, but there is no specific national holiday dedicated solely to Thanksgiving.",
