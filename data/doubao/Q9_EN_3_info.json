Here is a detailed analysis:- **American SPL Company and Its Chinese Subsidiary, Changzhou Kaipu Company**: The raw materials of heparin were produced by Changzhou Kaipu Company, a subsidiary of the American SPL Company. The investigation found that the heparin raw materials were contaminated with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate. As the producer, Kaipu Company had problems such as failing to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw materials, inadequate investigation of out - of - specification results, and failure to document actual processing steps in batch records. These issues indicate that Kaipu Company had significant deficiencies in the production process and quality control, which was one of the direct causes of the contamination crisis.- **Baxter International**: Baxter International was the company that produced and sold the heparin products. It purchased heparin ingredients from Changzhou Kaipu through SPL Company. From 2004 to 2008, Baxter International did not conduct sufficient inspections of the production facilities of its suppliers. It only sent one person to the Kaipu plant for a one - day inspection in September 2007, which was clearly insufficient to ensure the quality and safety of raw materials. This shows that Baxter International had serious negligence in the management of the supply chain and quality control. It should have taken more effective measures to supervise and inspect its suppliers to prevent the occurrence of contaminated products, but failed to do so.- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA had certain responsibilities in this crisis. On the one hand, due to a mistake, it did not conduct an inspection of the Changzhou Kaipu plant as scheduled, which led to the omission of potential problems in the early stage. On the other hand, the FDA did not have a sound mechanism for regularly inspecting overseas upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients such as heparin. Its inadequate supervision and lack of financial support for inspections made it difficult to ensure the quality and safety of imported drugs.In summary, the 2008 heparin contamination crisis was not caused by a single party. The SPL Company and its subsidiary Changzhou Kaipu Company, Baxter International, and the U.S. FDA all had certain faults and responsibilities in this incident.",
