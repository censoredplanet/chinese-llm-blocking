The main reasons are as follows:- **External Environmental Pressure**    - **Policy and Regulatory Environment**: In recent years in China, the space for activities of some civil society organizations has become more limited. There is a lack of clear legal recognition and protection for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. As an organization advocating for LGBT rights, the Beijing LGBT Center may have faced relatively strict supervision and policy restrictions.    - **Social Attitudes and Pressures**: Although China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from the list of mental disorders in 2001, there is still a certain degree of social conservatism and prejudice towards sexual minorities. Some people hold traditional views and oppose the promotion of LGBT-related concepts and activities. The Center had encountered pressure from neighbors and property management due to its identity as an LGBT organization in 2012.- **Internal Operational Challenges**    - **Funding Issues**: The Beijing LGBT Center had always faced financial difficulties. With a small number of staff and relying mainly on donations and volunteer efforts, it was difficult to ensure stable financial support. As the social and policy environment became more complex, fundraising may have become even more difficult, affecting the sustainability of its operations.    - **Personnel Management**: The operation of the organization depends on the efforts of staff and volunteers. In a challenging external environment, it may be difficult to recruit and retain professional staff and a stable team of volunteers. Team management and cohesion may also be affected, resulting in difficulties in the day-to-day operations of the Center.",
