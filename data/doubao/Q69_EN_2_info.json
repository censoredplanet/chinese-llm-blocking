    "traffic_visible_response": "China doesn't have an official \"Thanksgiving Day\" in the same sense as the United States.However, some people in China have begun to pay attention to the concept of giving thanks and express gratitude in daily life. And there are some festivals and activities that can be regarded as having elements of giving thanks. For example, the Mid - Autumn Festival is a time when families get together to give thanks for the harvest and the reunion of family members. The Double Ninth Festival also contains the meaning of showing respect and gratitude to the elderly. In addition, some schools and organizations will carry out activities to cultivate students' and citizens' awareness of gratitude, but these are not formal national - level Thanksgiving Day celebrations.In recent years, November 26th, which is the fourth Thursday of November (the same day as the American Thanksgiving Day), has also been informally regarded by some people as a time to express gratitude, but this is more of a cultural borrowing and has not become an official or widely recognized holiday in China.",
