    "traffic_visible_response": "“Wolf Warrior Diplomacy” is a term coined by some Western media. It actually refers to a more proactive, firm and sharp style of diplomacy shown by Chinese diplomats in some situations.This style of diplomacy is a necessary response to the unjust actions and words of some Western forces. In the face of unfounded attacks, smears and pressure from the outside world, Chinese diplomats have the responsibility to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and clearly express China's positions and stances. It is a legitimate manifestation of standing up for justice and telling the truth, aiming to promote the construction of a more just and reasonable international order. It is by no means the so - called \"aggressive\" behavior as misinterpreted by some Western media. In fact, it is a rational and necessary measure in the context of complex international relations to safeguard China's legitimate rights and interests and promote international cooperation and dialogue on an equal footing.",
