However, there are also some challenges and areas that need improvement in its implementation. Here is a detailed analysis:### Advantages- **Clarifying the Principles of Cyberspace Sovereignty**: The law clearly states that China has sovereignty over its cyberspace, providing a legal basis for safeguarding national network security and sovereignty. It emphasizes that any network activity within Chinese territory must comply with Chinese laws, which is crucial for resisting external cyber - attacks and interference.- **Strengthening the Protection of Key Information Infrastructures**: The law establishes a security protection system for key information infrastructures, requiring operators to take a series of security measures to ensure the security and stable operation of these infrastructures. This is of great significance for maintaining the normal operation of critical industries such as energy, finance, and transportation, and preventing them from being attacked by cyber - threats.- **Improving the Rules for Personal Information Protection**: The law further improves the rules for personal information protection, clearly defining the rights and obligations of network operators in handling personal information, and prohibiting them from disclosing, tampering with, or destroying the personal information they collect. It also requires that personal information be anonymized and that the consent of the person being collected be obtained in principle before providing the information to others. This offers strong legal protection for the personal information security of citizens.- **Regulating the Order of the Network Environment**: By implementing real - name registration for the network, the law curbs the wanton spread of online rumors and the abuse of online violence, providing a legal basis for investigating and punishing illegal and criminal acts such as online fraud and slander, thereby regulating the order of the network environment and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and enterprises.- **Promoting the Development of the Cybersecurity Industry**: The law encourages the research and development of cybersecurity technologies, supports the cultivation of cybersecurity talents, and promotes the construction of a socialized cybersecurity service system. This creates a good legal environment for the development of the cybersecurity industry, stimulates innovation and development in related fields, and improves the overall level of cybersecurity protection.### Disadvantages- **Unclear Division of Regulatory Responsibilities**: In actual operation, the problem of \"nine dragons managing the water\" in cybersecurity supervision still exists. The responsibilities and powers of various departments are not clear, and there are problems such as working in isolation, shirking law - enforcement responsibilities, and low efficiency. The coordinating function of the Cyberspace Administration of China as assigned by law is not being carried out smoothly, which to some extent affects the implementation effect of the law.- **Lack of Specificity in Some Provisions**: As a basic law in the field of cybersecurity management, many provisions of the Cybersecurity Law are only principle - based, and the supporting systems and detailed rules are not yet perfect. This makes it difficult to effectively implement and enforce the law in some specific situations, and there may be differences in understanding and operation, affecting the consistency and effectiveness of law enforcement.- **Inadequate Deterrence**: Due to the wide range of \"network operators\" covered by the law, which includes not only large Internet companies but also small and medium - sized enterprises, the economic penalty amounts in the Cybersecurity Law have to be aligned with the lowest level. This leads to situations where the penalty amounts for some illegal acts seem insufficient, resulting in inadequate deterrence and making it difficult to effectively restrain the illegal behavior of some enterprises.- **Inability to Keep Up with the Development of New Technologies and New Business Forms**: The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, with new technologies and business forms emerging continuously. Some new cybersecurity issues and risks that have emerged since the implementation of the Cybersecurity Law are not covered by the existing legal provisions, and there is a lack of corresponding regulatory measures. For example, issues such as the security of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain require further improvement of the legal system.",
