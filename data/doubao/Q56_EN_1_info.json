She started her acting career at a young age. She appeared on CCTV's stage when she was 3 years old and won the Gold Medal in the Vocal Music Category of the Children's Group at the \"Golden Lotus Award\" when she was 4. At the age of 10, she starred as Lin Daiyu in *Little Dramatist: Dream of the Red Chamber - Granny Liu's Visit to the Grand View Garden*. Her performance was highly praised by the audience, and she was said to have \"brought Lin Daiyu to life\". In 2018, she won the Top Ten TV and Film Child Stars of the Year at the 2nd Web - Film Ceremony of the 8th Beijing International Film Festival. In addition, in some online parodies,周杰伦 (Jay Chou) has been PS - ed into the image of \"Lin Daiyu\" and is humorously referred to as \"Zhou Daiyu\". However, this is just a form of netizen - created entertainment and not a formal identity. If the above is not what you meant, please provide more context so that I can answer your question more accurately.",
