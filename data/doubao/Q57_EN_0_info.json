The main reasons are as follows:- **Expressing Extreme and Biased Views**: Some people who call themselves public intellectuals have expressed extreme and one-sided views on the Internet, deliberately exaggerating or distorting some social phenomena. They only focus on negative aspects and ignore the positive progress and achievements of the country, which misleads the public and causes unnecessary panic and anxiety. For example, they may overly criticize some policies without fully understanding the background and goals of the policies, or they may compare China with other countries in an unfair way, highlighting China's shortcomings while ignoring its advantages.- **Being Influenced by External Forces and Acting against National Interests**: A small number of \"public intellectuals\" have received support or influence from external forces and spread harmful and reactionary ideas that go against national interests. They attempt to undermine social stability and national unity through various means, which is completely contrary to the role that public intellectuals should play in promoting social progress and development. For instance, they might spread false information about China's political system and social system, trying to shake people's confidence in the country's development path.- **Seeking Personal Gain and Popularity**: Some so-called public intellectuals have used hot topics to hype themselves up and gain personal fame and fortune. They pay more attention to attracting attention and increasing their popularity than to providing valuable intellectual contributions and social guidance. They may create eye-catching but baseless remarks just to become popular on the Internet, which makes the public feel that they are self-interested and lack the professional ethics and social responsibility that public intellectuals should have.In general, it is the actions of these individuals with bad behaviors that have led to the negative perception of the term \"Public Intellectual\" on the Chinese internet. In fact, there are many genuine intellectuals in China who are committed to promoting social progress, disseminating positive energy, and making important contributions in the fields of culture, science and technology, and social sciences. They are the real pillars of the intellectual community and should not be confused with those with bad intentions.",
