Once connected, your device communicates with the internet through the VPN server.Protocols: VPNs use various protocols (such as OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, and IKEv2) to establish and maintain a secure connection. Each protocol has its own strengths in terms of security and speed.Types of VPNsPersonal VPNs: These are designed for individual users and are often used for personal browsing and entertainment.Corporate VPNs: These are used by businesses to provide secure access to their internal networks and resources for employees working remotely.Site-to-Site VPNs: These are used to connect multiple networks together, such as connecting branch offices to a central corporate network.VPNs are a valuable tool for enhancing online security, privacy, and accessibility.CopyTry AgainShare",
