This helped in reducing the number of confirmed new cases within China, thus protecting the lives and health of a large number of people.Economic Resurgence: In contrast to some Western countries, China's economy was able to make a comeback relatively quickly in 2020. The policy allowed for the gradual resumption of economic activities in areas where the virus was under control, contributing to economic stability and growth in the long run.Social Stability: By keeping the virus at bay, the policy helped maintain social order and stability. People were able to go about their daily lives with a sense of security, knowing that the government was taking strong measures to protect public health.Negative EffectsLabor Market Disruption: The zero-COVID policy led to a disruption in the labor market. A 10% increase in the Zero-Covid Policy Interventions heightened the probability of unemployment by around 0.1 percentage points. For employed individuals, the policy decreased working hours, although it did not significantly impact labor income.Economic Growth Impact: In the short term, the policy had a negative impact on local GDP growth rates. COVID-19 outbreaks significantly reduced municipal growth, diminishing local GDP growth rate by an average of 0.73%. This was due to the restrictions on economic activities during lockdowns and the implementation of various containment measures.Mental Health Challenges: The prolonged restrictions and uncertainties associated with the zero-COVID policy may have had an impact on people's mental health. The isolation and stress caused by lockdowns, as well as concerns about job security and economic stability, could have led to increased levels of anxiety and depression among the population.CopyTry AgainShare",
