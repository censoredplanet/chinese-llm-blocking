These manual methods have gradually evolved into more technologically advanced systems.Modern Development: In 1998, the Golden Shield Project (GSP) was launched, aiming to create a fully digitized public security sector using a national surveillance network. This project has since expanded significantly, incorporating advanced technologies like AI and facial recognition.Key Surveillance Programs and TechnologiesSharp Eyes and Skynet: The Sharp Eyes program, launched in 2015, builds on the Skynet initiative and extends surveillance into rural areas. It integrates data from various sources, including surveillance cameras, vehicle and license plate recognition systems, and even \"virtual identities\" like MAC addresses and social media accounts.Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP): In Xinjiang, the IJOP is a highly intrusive system that ties individuals' physical attributes and movements to their government-issued ID cards. It collects data from various sources, including mobile phones and even mundane activities like electricity usage, to flag individuals for further surveillance or detention.Social Credit System: While still fragmented, this system aims to monitor and rate citizens' behavior, rewarding or penalizing them based on their actions.
