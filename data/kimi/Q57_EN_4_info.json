    "UI_visible_response": "The term “Public Intellectual” has been stigmatized on the Chinese internet for several reasons:### Political Factors- **Government Attitude and Measures**: The Chinese government has been critical of some public intellectuals who hold liberal or dissenting views. In 2004, the Central Propaganda Department issued a decree blacklisting six public intellectuals from the state-owned press. This official stance has influenced public perception to some extent.- **Perceived Political Agendas**: Some people believe that certain public intellectuals are overly influenced by Western ideologies and have political agendas that do not align with China's national interests or the government's policies. They are seen as promoting values and ideas that could potentially disrupt social stability or undermine the authority of the government.### Social and Cultural Factors- **High Expectations and Criticism**: In China, people expect public intellectuals to be almost perfect, both in terms of their viewpoints and their private lives. If a public intellectual makes a mistake or if there is a perceived flaw in their personal life, they are likely to face intense criticism and be accused of hypocrisy, which can lead to a negative image.- **Anti-Intellectual Populism**: The popularization of the internet has fueled the rise of anti-intellectual populism in China. Some netizens may feel that public intellectuals are elitist and out of touch with the common people. They may view intellectuals' opinions as unnecessary or even harmful, and thus choose to criticize and stigmatize them.- **Cultural Misunderstandings and Stereotypes**: There are cultural misunderstandings and stereotypes about public intellectuals. For example, some netizens may associate public intellectuals with certain negative traits, such as being overly critical, spreading rumors, or manipulating public opinion for personal gain. These stereotypes can spread easily on the internet and contribute to the stigmatization.### Internet Environment and Communication Factors- **Amplification of Negative Opinions**: The internet provides a platform for people to express their opinions freely and anonymously. This can lead to the amplification of negative opinions and criticisms of public intellectuals. A single negative comment or joke about public intellectuals can quickly spread and gain traction, influencing more people's perceptions.- **Lack of Nuanced Discussions**: Online discussions about public intellectuals often lack nuance and depth. People may oversimplify complex issues and engage in black-and-white thinking. This can result in unfair and one-sided criticisms of public intellectuals, further stigmatizing the term.- **Misuse of the Term**: The term \"public intellectual\" has been misused and overused in some cases. Some people may label themselves or others as public intellectuals for personal gain or attention, without actually having the qualifications or expertise. This has led to a devaluation of the term and made it easier for it to be stigmatized.",
