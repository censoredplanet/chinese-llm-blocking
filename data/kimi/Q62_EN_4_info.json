It was triggered by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, who set himself on fire in protest against government corruption and the confiscation of his merchandise. His act became a symbol of the widespread economic hardship and political repression faced by many Tunisians under President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.The protests quickly spread across the country, with people demanding an end to corruption, better employment opportunities, and political freedom. The Tunisian government’s attempts to quell the unrest, including the use of force, led to international criticism and further fueled the protests. Despite President Ben Ali’s concessions, such as promising not to seek re-election and reducing food prices, the protesters remained undeterred. On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali was forced to step down and leave the country.The Jasmine Revolution not only led to the ouster of Ben Ali but also inspired a wave of similar uprisings throughout the Middle East and North Africa, collectively known as the Arab Spring. Tunisia’s revolution is widely regarded as the only one of these uprisings to have successfully transitioned to a stable democratic government.CopyTry AgainShare",
