People's Democratic DictatorshipEssence: The people's democratic dictatorship is the essence of China's political system. It means that the people are the masters of the country. The vast majority of the population, including workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other social strata, have the right to participate in the political process and enjoy extensive democratic rights.Example: In the National People's Congress (NPC) elections, people from all walks of life can vote to elect their representatives. These representatives then exercise state power on behalf of the people.2. Democratic CentralismPrinciple: Democratic centralism is a fundamental organizational principle of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the state institutions. It combines democracy based on centralism and centralism guided by democracy.Example: Within the CPC, members can fully express their opinions and suggestions during discussions. Once a decision is made through democratic procedures, it is implemented in a unified manner. This ensures both the full expression of democracy and the efficient implementation of policies.3. Extensive Participation in Decision - MakingPublic Consultation: The Chinese government often consults the public before making important decisions. For example, when drafting laws and regulations, the government releases draft versions for public comment. People can submit their suggestions and opinions through various channels such as online platforms and written letters.Example: In the process of formulating the 14th Five - Year Plan (2021 - 2025), the government collected a large number of suggestions from the public. These suggestions covered various fields such as economic development, social welfare, and environmental protection, which were taken into account in the final plan.4. Grass - Roots DemocracyVillage and Community Governance: In rural areas, the village committee system is an important form of grass - roots democracy. Villagers elect their own representatives to form the village committee, which is responsible for managing village affairs. Similarly, in urban communities, residents can participate in community management through the residents' committee.Example: In a village, decisions such as the allocation of land resources and the construction of public facilities are made through village meetings. Villagers can fully express their views and participate in the decision - making process.CopyTry AgainShare",
