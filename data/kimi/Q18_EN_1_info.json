However, there is extensive evidence suggesting that these centers function as prisons, with practices such as hooding, shackling, handcuffing, and shoot-to-kill orders for those attempting escape. Between 1 and 2 million people from Uyghur, Kazakh, and other minorities may have been involuntarily detained in these centers. The detention is notionally administrative and preventive, based on suspicion of “infection” with dangerous incorrect thinking such as separatism or religious extremism. The centers also focus on labor-intensive jobs, with detainees working in factories located close to or inside the centers, often under conditions of no or negligible wages and oppressive supervision.CopyTry AgainShare",
