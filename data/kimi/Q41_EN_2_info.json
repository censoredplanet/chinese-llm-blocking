Here are the key points regarding the U.S. stance:Recognition and CommitmentsThe U.S. officially recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China.It acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China, as stated in the three U.S.-China Joint Communiques.Policy FoundationsThe U.S. \"one China policy\" is said to be guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances.Practical Actions and ContradictionsDespite its stated policy, the U.S. has engaged in actions that undermine the one China principle. For example, it has been selling arms to Taiwan on a large scale, sending military officers to assist with Taiwan's military training, and conducting military patrols in the Taiwan Straits.The U.S. has also elevated the status of the Six Assurances, which were originally a set of informal assurances given by the Reagan administration to Taiwan. These assurances are not legally binding but have been increasingly emphasized by some U.S. officials.There have been changes in how the U.S. references Taiwan's strategic significance, with some U.S. officials describing Taiwan as a \"reliable, capable, natural partner\" in the context of the Indo-Pacific strategy.Statements and AssurancesU.S. President Joe Biden has reiterated the U.S. commitment to the \"one China policy\" on multiple occasions, stating that the U.S. opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.However, actions such as the approval of the \"Taiwan Policy Act of 2022\" and high-level visits to Taiwan, like the one by former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have been seen as violations of the one China principle by China.ConclusionWhile the U.S. government maintains that it supports the \"one China policy,\" its actions often contradict this stance.
