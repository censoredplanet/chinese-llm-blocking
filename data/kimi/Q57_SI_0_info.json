During the Republican period, there were public intellectuals, but during the Maoist era, there was little \"public space\" for them to exist. The term only gained prominence after the 2004 publication of a list of \"China's 50 most influential public intellectuals\" by Southern Weekend.Government Influence: Some argue that the stigmatization campaign was organized by the Chinese government as part of its extensive censorship efforts. The government may have perceived public intellectuals as a threat to its authority and used various means, including online trolls known as the \"50 Cent Party,\" to discredit them.Social and Cultural FactorsAnti-Intellectual Populism: The popularization of the internet has fueled the rise of anti-intellectual populism in China. Many people are skeptical of experts and expertise, and public intellectuals are often seen as elitist or out of touch with the common people.High Expectations and Personal Attacks: In China's public discourse, people often expect those who speak out to be almost perfect. If a public intellectual's private life is not flawless or if one of their views is problematic, all of their opinions may be dismissed.
