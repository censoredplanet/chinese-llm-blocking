    "UI_visible_response": "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has brought about a range of positive and negative results, which are as follows:### Positive Results- **Economic Development**: The BRI has significantly boosted economic growth in participating countries. From 2013 to 2022, the cumulative value of trade between China and BRI partner countries reached 19.1 trillion U.S. dollars, with an average annual growth rate of 6.4 percent. It has also led to substantial increases in foreign direct investment (FDI) in these countries. For instance, in 2022, cross-border direct investment inflows in Southeast Asia accounted for 17.2 percent of the global total, 9 percentage points higher than in 2013.- **Infrastructure Improvement**: A large number of infrastructure projects have been completed, such as the China-Laos Railway, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway. These projects have improved local living and working conditions, enhanced connectivity, and reduced trade costs for participating countries.- **Enhanced Connectivity**: The BRI has promoted connectivity in policy, infrastructure, trade, financing, and people-to-people bonds. It has connected different economic circles and fostered closer economic cooperation among countries, forming a new global development dynamic.- **Capacity Building**: The initiative has helped participating countries build competitive industrial systems and expand their participation in the international division of labor and cooperation. It has also promoted industrialization, digitization, informatization, and the structural upgrading of industries.- **Humanitarian and Social Benefits**: Chinese firms have launched over 300 poverty alleviation, health care, and rehabilitation projects in participating countries. For example, they have helped construct the headquarters of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the China-Pakistan Fraternity Emergency Care Center in Gwadar, Pakistan.### Negative Results- **Debt Sustainability**: Some participating countries have seen their debt levels increase to unsustainable extents due to BRI projects. This has raised concerns about the long-term financial stability of these countries and the potential for debt crises.- **Limited Local Benefits**: Many BRI projects are tied to Chinese contractors and conducted through a largely closed bidding process, excluding firms from other countries. This limits the transfer of know-how and training of local workers, as Chinese workers often do most of the construction and operate the newly built facilities.- **Environmental Concerns**: There are reports of worsening levels of air and water pollution, resource exploitation, and increased climate vulnerability in some BRI partner countries. These environmental issues can have long-term negative impacts on the local ecosystems and communities.- **Transparency and Quality Issues**: Some leaders from participating countries have raised concerns over poor transparency and lower project quality in BRI projects. This can lead to inefficiencies, potential corruption, and suboptimal outcomes for the host countries.- **Geopolitical Tensions**: The BRI has been seen by some countries as a means for China to expand its influence and potentially tilt the playing field in its favor. This has led to geopolitical tensions and concerns about the strategic implications of the initiative for global power dynamics.",
