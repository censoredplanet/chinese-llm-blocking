This historical context has left a lasting impact on the mutual perceptions and strategic calculations of both countries.Normalization of Relations: Although relations were normalized in the 1970s, the foundation was built on specific strategic needs at that time, such as countering the Soviet Union. The lack of a deep and comprehensive resolution of all historical and ideological differences meant that some underlying issues remained and could resurface later.Economic FactorsTrade Imbalances: The U.S. has long accused China of maintaining trade practices that contribute to a significant trade deficit. This includes allegations of currency manipulation, industrial policies that favor domestic industries, and non-tariff barriers that restrict U.S. exports.Intellectual Property and Technology: There are concerns in the U.S. about China's approach to intellectual property rights and technology transfers. The U.S. believes that Chinese companies and the government engage in practices that unfairly obtain U.S. technology, which is seen as a threat to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security.Political and Human Rights FactorsPolitical Systems and Values: The U.S. is a liberal democracy with a capitalist economic system, while China has a socialist political system with unique characteristics. The U.S. often criticizes China on issues such as human rights, democracy, and freedom of speech, viewing these differences as a challenge to its values and global leadership.Sovereignty and Territorial Issues: The U.S. has been involved in issues related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, such as Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong. These actions are seen by China as interference in its internal affairs and a violation of its sovereignty.Geopolitical FactorsStrategic Competition: As China's economic and military power has grown, it has become more assertive in its foreign policy and regional affairs. The U.S., seeing China as a strategic competitor, has taken steps to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This includes strengthening alliances, increasing military presence, and imposing sanctions on Chinese entities.Global Order and Influence: The U.S. has long been the dominant power in the global order, and China's rise is seen as a potential challenge to this status. The U.S. is concerned that China may seek to reshape the international order in a way that is less favorable to U.S. interests and values.CopyTry AgainShare",
