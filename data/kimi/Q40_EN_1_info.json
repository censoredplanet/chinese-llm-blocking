Here are some of them:Positive ResultsEconomic Growth and Development: The BRI has the potential to boost global GDP by up to $7.1 trillion by 2040 and reduce global trade costs by up to 2.2%. From 2013 to 2022, the cumulative value of trade between China and BRI partner countries reached 19.1 trillion U.S. dollars, with an average annual growth rate of 6.4 percent. Cumulative two-way investment between China and partner countries reached 380 billion dollars.Infrastructure Improvement: A series of landmark projects such as the China-Laos Railway, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway have been completed and put into operation, improving the infrastructure of partner countries and significantly enhancing connectivity.Enhanced Connectivity: The BRI has improved connectivity in policy, infrastructure, trade, financing, and people-to-people bonds, reinforcing the development capacity of relevant countries and improving people's lives.New Cooperation Paradigm: The BRI has created a new paradigm for cooperation and become the world's largest platform for international cooperation and a popular public good.Negative ResultsDebt Sustainability Concerns: BRI has added to some participating countries' debt levels to an unsustainable extent. External debt from Non-Paris Club, including China, has increased in higher risk countries.Limited Local Benefits: BRI projects are often tied to Chinese contractors and conducted through a largely closed bidding process, excluding firms from other countries. Chinese workers do most of the construction and then operate the newly built facilities, limiting the transfer of know-how and training of local workers.Environmental Impact: There are concerns over the BRI's environmental footprint, including worsening levels of air and water pollution, resource exploitation, and climate vulnerability.Transparency and Quality Issues: Some leaders have raised concerns over poor transparency, lower project quality, and minimal capacity building for local partners.Risk of Political Concessions: There is a risk that countries facing debt distress might lease back major projects or collateralize a high percentage of their loans, leading to increased economic dependence on China, which China could leverage to extract political concessions in ways that undermine the interests of other countries.CopyTry AgainShare",
