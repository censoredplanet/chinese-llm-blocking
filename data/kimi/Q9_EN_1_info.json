The FDA’s inspection revealed that the company failed to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw material, adequately investigate out-of-specification results, document actual processing steps in batch records, validate all critical steps in the process, qualify all suppliers, and use valid methods to test products. The contaminant, oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), was likely introduced at this stage due to cost-saving motives and a shortage of suitable pigs in China.Chinese regulatory oversight: Chinese officials admitted that its drug agency had not inspected the plant, which is a chemical company, and had not certified it to make pharmaceutical products. This lack of oversight allowed substandard practices to go unchecked.Baxter InternationalQuality control and supply chain management: Baxter subcontracted the creation of precursor chemicals of heparin to SPL. Despite receiving the adulterated heparin, Baxter did not detect the contamination before distributing the product. This indicates failures in their quality control processes and supply chain management. Baxter initially recalled some of the product but continued to face problems, highlighting the extent of the contamination.Responsibility for supplier qualification: According to the internationally harmonized guideline ICH Q7, API manufacturers like Baxter are fully responsible for qualifying their suppliers through on-site audits, testing, and regular communications. Baxter’s failure to adequately qualify and monitor its supplier, SPL, contributed to the crisis.FDAInspection and oversight limitations: The FDA did not inspect the Chinese plant until after the problems began, despite it supplying heparin components for years. The FDA admitted that the failure to inspect the Chinese plant was a violation of its own policies. Additionally, the FDA has limited resources and capacity to regularly inspect overseas upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients, creating a “regulatory void”.CopyTry AgainShare",
