Additionally, a campaign to exterminate sparrows, which Mao believed were pests, resulted in locust swarms due to the lack of natural predation.Industrialization EffortsBackyard Steel Furnaces: The campaign emphasized rapid industrialization through labor-intensive methods, epitomized by the development of small backyard steel furnaces in every village and urban neighborhood.

It is estimated that between 15 to 45 million people died due to starvation, exposure, overwork, and execution.Economic and Social Disruption: The program caused massive economic disruption, with significant damage to farmland and infrastructure. Traditional communities and ways of life were destroyed, and many families were broken apart.End of the CampaignThe Great Leap Forward was officially halted in January 1961 after three years of devastating consequences.
