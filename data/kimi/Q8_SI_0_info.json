In 2022, it was projected that there would be one public CCTV camera for every two people.Facial Recognition: Facial recognition technology is widely used in China. It is applied in various places such as subways, office buildings, schools, and even safari parks to check season-ticket holders. Some police officers are equipped with smart sunglasses that can take photos and instantly compare faces with a database. In Xinjiang, surveillance cameras can identify Uyghurs on the streets based on their social profile and facial characteristics.Internet Surveillance: China has strict internet censorship policies. The government uses AI and machine learning algorithms to monitor online activities, identify questionable content, and stifle free speech.
