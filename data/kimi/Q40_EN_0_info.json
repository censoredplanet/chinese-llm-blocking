For example, from 2014 to 2018, China’s real GDP achieved a positive average treatment effect of 14.8% due to the BRI. It has also enhanced trade and investment between China and BRI countries, reducing trade costs and improving trade efficiency.Infrastructure Improvement: Many countries have benefited from improved infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports, and energy facilities. For instance, the China-Laos Railway has enhanced connectivity and economic development in Laos.Technological Innovation: The initiative has spurred innovation in technology firms through global value chain cooperation and market expansion. It has also promoted the transfer and application of advanced technologies, such as green energy and digital infrastructure, in participating countries.Cultural Exchange: The BRI has facilitated cultural exchanges and people-to-people bonds among different countries. It has led to increased tourism, educational exchanges, and cultural events, fostering mutual understanding and friendship.Environmental Protection: Some studies have shown that the BRI has had a positive impact on reducing environmental pollution in cities along the B&R route through improvements in technological innovation and resource allocation efficiencies.Negative ResultsDebt Sustainability: Several countries have faced significant debt burdens due to BRI projects. For example, Pakistan now faces a staggering $69 billion debt to China. Sri Lanka’s inability to repay its debt for the Hambantota Port led to China gaining control through a 99-year lease.Project Delays and Failures: There have been numerous instances of unfinished or delayed projects. In Southeast Asia, only 35% of China's infrastructure projects have reached completion. The Gwadar Port in Pakistan remains non-functional due to poor planning and security concerns.Environmental Concerns: While there are some positive aspects, the BRI has also raised environmental concerns. Some projects have led to increased energy consumption and potential environmental degradation. In Pakistan, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) energy projects have been linked to environmental and climate risks.Geopolitical Tensions: The initiative has faced geopolitical challenges and skepticism from some countries and international actors. The involvement of Chinese contractors in democratic countries has been particularly contentious. The perception of the BRI as a mechanism for extending Chinese influence rather than fostering genuine economic development has led to strained diplomatic relationships.Social and Political Risks: In some countries, BRI projects have led to social and political issues such as worker displacement, local opposition, and concerns over national sovereignty. For example, in Cambodia, local stakeholders have expressed concerns about the political risks associated with Chinese investment in the tourism and entertainment sector.CopyTry AgainShare",
