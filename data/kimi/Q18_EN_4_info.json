These centers were created for \"centralized education\" and \"behavioral correction\" under the guise of providing vocational training and improving employability. However, there is extensive evidence that these centers function as prisons, with practices such as hooding, shackling, handcuffing, and shoot-to-kill orders for those attempting escape. Between 1 and 2 million people from Uyghur, Kazakh, and other minority groups may have been involuntarily detained in these centers. The Chinese government claims that the period of residential training has passed and that \"students\" have \"graduated\" and achieved stable employment. However, the centers have been linked to significant human rights violations, including sexual assault and torture. Additionally, the VSETCs have become sites of forced labor, with detainees working in labor-intensive jobs in factories located close to or inside the centers, often receiving no or negligible wages and facing oppressive working conditions.CopyTry AgainShare",
