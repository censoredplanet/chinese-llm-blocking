This allowed China to keep its infection rate and death toll relatively low compared to many other countries during the early stages of the pandemic.Protection of Vulnerable Populations: It provided a relatively safe environment for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with underlying health conditions, and children, who are more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19.Economic Recovery in Certain Periods: In some periods, the policy facilitated an economic resurgence, as it allowed for the resumption of economic activities in areas where the virus was effectively controlled. For example, after the initial outbreak in Wuhan was brought under control, China was able to gradually reopen its economy and achieve positive economic growth in certain quarters.Negative EffectsEconomic Disruption: The strict measures led to a decline in mobility, which in turn affected economic activities. For instance, in 2022, the zero-COVID policy resulted in a 30% decline in mobility, a 1.17% decrease in PM2.5, and a 7.7% reduction in night lights. This had a negative impact on various sectors, including retail, hospitality, and tourism, as consumer spending and business operations were curtailed.Labor Market Impact: The policy heightened the probability of unemployment. A 10% increase in Zero-COVID Policy Interventions (ZPIs) raised the probability of unemployment by around 0.1 percentage points. For employed individuals, it decreased working hours, although it did not significantly affect labor income. The impact was heterogeneous across different demographics, including gender, age, education level, and whether individuals had young children.Mental Health Challenges: The policy transition from zero-COVID to a more relaxed approach, along with the associated uncertainty, had significant effects on people's mental health. During the transition period and the subsequent free-spread period, there was a substantial increase in searches related to fear and social dysfunction. Anxiety also increased during the transition period. The prolonged restrictions and uncertainty led to stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues for many people.Social and Lifestyle Changes: The policy led to changes in people's daily lives, including disruptions to education, as schools were closed or shifted to online learning. Social interactions and gatherings were also limited, affecting people's social lives and well-being.CopyTry AgainShare",

This allowed China to keep its infection rate and death toll relatively low compared to many other countries during the early stages of the pandemic.- **Protection of Vulnerable Populations**: It provided a relatively safe environment for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with underlying health conditions, and children, who are more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19.- **Economic Recovery in Certain Periods**: In some periods, the policy facilitated an economic resurgence, as it allowed for the resumption of economic activities in areas where the virus was effectively controlled[^5^].
