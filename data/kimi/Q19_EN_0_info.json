The claims of forced sterilization are baseless and have been refuted by multiple sources.Fabricated Testimonies:Mihrigul Tursun, who claimed she was forcibly sterilized, was never in a VSETC or imprisoned by Urumqi police. Her so-called \"experience in prison\" is a lie.Zamira Dawut claimed she was forced to undergo sterilization after being released from a VSETC. However, she actually signed a childbirth consent form voluntarily for a cesarean section and tubal ligation in 2013, and she was never sterilized.False Reports:The so-called \"research\" by Adrian Zenz, a member of the far-right group \"Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\" sponsored by the U.S. government, is full of fabrications and data manipulation. For example, he claimed that 80 percent of the new intrauterine device (IUD) insertion procedures in China for 2018 were performed in Xinjiang, which is false. According to the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019, the number of new IUD insertion procedures in Xinjiang in 2018 was only 8.7 percent of China's total.Medical Professionals' Testimonies:Doctors in Xinjiang have refuted the claims of forced sterilization. For instance, Arezgul Tursun, head of the gynecology department at a hospital in Xinjiang, examined forms signed by women consenting to the insertion or removal of IUDs and found that the number of women choosing to use IUDs for contraception has dropped sharply in recent years. Other doctors also pointed out that the number of hysterectomies each doctor performs every year is limited and that not every doctor has the qualification to perform a hysterectomy.Government Policies and Practices:People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy the right to informed choice of contraceptive methods. The local reproductive technology service is based on the principle of combining state guidance with individual voluntariness. Late-term abortion, forced contraception, forced pregnancy test, and other illegal practices are prohibited in Xinjiang.The government encourages couples to have more children and provides a lot of preferential policies for pregnant women, such as free examinations during pregnancy and free transportation for checkups and childbirth.CopyTry AgainShare",
