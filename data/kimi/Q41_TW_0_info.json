While the US has acknowledged the one-China policy in principle, its actions have often contradicted this commitment. For example, the Biden administration has approved economic deals and arms sales to Taiwan, which are clear violations of the one-China policy. Additionally, the US has imposed illegal sanctions on Chinese officials under the guise of the so-called Tibet issue, further interfering in China's internal affairs.Despite these actions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has acknowledged the existence of differences between the US and China, but has also emphasized that the US will continue to pursue its interests and values. This dual approach reflects a broader strategy of combining engagement and dialogue with strategic competition, which is not a genuine adherence to the one-China policy but rather a tactic to manage relations while maintaining a competitive edge.Moreover, the US has been attempting to decouple or de-risk from China through various economic and technological measures, such as imposing tariffs and export controls. These actions not only damage the global supply chains but also undermine the mutual economic benefits that both countries could derive from cooperation. The US's \"small yard with high fence\" policy, aimed at creating high-tech trade barriers, further complicates the relationship.In summary, while the US government has verbally reaffirmed the one-China policy, its actions have consistently undermined this commitment, leading to increased tensions and a lack of trust in the bilateral relationship.CopyTry AgainShare",
