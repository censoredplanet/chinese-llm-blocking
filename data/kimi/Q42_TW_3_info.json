These different historical experiences have shaped their distinct national identities and worldviews.Contrasting Political Systems and Values: The US is a capitalist democracy with a focus on individual rights and freedoms, while China is a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, emphasizing collective interests and social harmony.
