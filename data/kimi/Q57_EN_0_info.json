In 2004, the Central Propaganda Department issued a decree blacklisting six public intellectuals from the state-owned press. This official stance set a negative tone and led many to view public intellectuals as troublemakers.Perceived Threat to Stability: Some public intellectuals advocate for political reforms or express dissenting views on social issues. The government fears that their influence could stir up unrest or undermine social stability, so it tries to discredit them to reduce their impact.Social and Cultural FactorsAnti-intellectual Populism: The popularization of the internet has fueled the rise of anti-intellectual populism in China. Many netizens prefer simple, straightforward opinions and are skeptical of complex, nuanced arguments. They view public intellectuals as elitist and out of touch with ordinary people’s concerns.High Expectations and Hypocrisy Claims: On China’s public speech platforms, people expect those who speak out to be almost perfect. If a public intellectual’s private life is not flawless or if one of their views is problematic, all their views are suspect. This has led to a perception that public intellectuals are hypocrites.Media and Internet EnvironmentAmplification of Negative Narratives: The internet allows for the rapid spread of information and opinions. Negative portrayals of public intellectuals, whether through sarcastic jokes, false quotations, or critical incidents, can quickly go viral and shape public perception. For example, a joke that homophones “public intellectuals” with “male Zhi mates with female Zhu (sows)” circulated widely.Opportunists and Misuse of the Label: The prominence of public intellectuals has incentivized some people to exploit the label for personal gain. These opportunists may not have genuine intellectual credentials or expertise but still claim to be public intellectuals. Their actions and statements have tarnished the reputation of the group.Historical and Ideological FactorsLack of Clear Definition and Distinction: Over the past 60 years, China has not made close distinctions between different kinds of intellectuals. This has led to a broad and sometimes vague understanding of who public intellectuals are, making it easier for negative stereotypes to take hold.Contestation Between Different Ideologies: The contestation between liberal and conservative ideologies in China has also contributed to the stigmatization. Public intellectuals are often associated with liberal ideas, which are sometimes seen as a threat by conservative forces.CopyTry AgainShare",
