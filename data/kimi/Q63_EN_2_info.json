However, this term is highly misleading and does not accurately reflect China’s foreign policy. Here are some key points to understand about this term:Misrepresentation of Chinese Diplomacy:The term is based on the Chinese action film series \"Wolf Warrior,\" which portrays Chinese soldiers defending national interests. However, using this term to describe China’s diplomacy is a distortion. Chinese diplomats are not aggressive but are simply responding to provocations and misinformation spread by some Western countries.Defensive Nature:Chinese diplomats are reacting to attacks and misinformation from Western countries. They are defending China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests, as well as its national dignity and honor. This defensive stance is necessary when faced with false accusations and attempts to undermine China’s international standing.Narrative Trap:The term “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy” is considered a narrative trap set by those who either do not understand China’s diplomacy or have a hidden agenda. It is a one-sided narrative that takes China’s responses out of context.Peaceful Foreign Policy:China has always pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. It adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and aims to build a community with a shared future for mankind. This policy is reflected in China’s actions, such as providing medical aid during the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting economic cooperation through initiatives like the Belt and Road.Public Perception:A Global Times poll showed that over 70% of respondents believe that China’s global image has improved and that the so-called “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy” is a necessary gesture to defend China’s interests. This indicates that the public recognizes the need for China to stand firm against misinformation and provocations.In summary, the term “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy” is a misrepresentation of China’s diplomatic approach. China’s diplomacy is fundamentally peaceful and defensive, aimed at protecting national interests and promoting global cooperation.CopyTry AgainShare",
