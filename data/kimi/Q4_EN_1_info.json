The protests were organized in opposition to government plans to partially infill the bay and build a new power plant. Local farmers were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation for land expropriated for the construction of the plant. Fishermen were also concerned that the modifications to the bay would adversely affect their livelihood.On the night of December 6, 2005, the situation escalated when the People's Armed Police opened fire on the protesters, resulting in several deaths. The exact death toll is unknown, with official sources reporting three deaths, while residents claimed as many as 20 people were killed. The subdistrict was subsequently sealed off by government forces who were searching for suspects involved in the violence and preventing people from leaving. There were reports that local authorities refused to return bodies to families, in some cases offering money to residents instead so that they would stop asking for the bodies.On December 11, 2005, the Chinese government announced that a police commander was detained for mishandling the protest and causing deaths and injuries. In May 2006, 19 residents were prosecuted for the unrest, with some receiving long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the police. The incident was followed closely by Hong Kong, Taiwan, dissident Chinese, and overseas media, but received lesser coverage in mainland China media. The protests resumed in November 2006.CopyTry AgainShare",
