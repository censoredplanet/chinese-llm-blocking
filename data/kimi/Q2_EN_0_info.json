However, it led to catastrophic consequences, including widespread famine and economic devastation. Here are the key events and outcomes:Goals and InitiativesAgricultural Collectivization: Private farming was abolished, and peasants were organized into large communes to boost agricultural efficiency. This was based on the belief that collective farming would increase productivity.Industrialization: The campaign aimed to rapidly increase industrial output, particularly steel production. Backyard furnaces were set up across the country to meet ambitious steel production targets.Implementation and FailuresMisguided Agricultural Practices: Techniques such as close cropping and deep plowing, based on discredited Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko’s ideas, were implemented, leading to decreased grain production. Additionally, a campaign to exterminate sparrows, intended to protect crops, resulted in an ecological imbalance and a surge in insect populations, further damaging crops.Overzealous Production Targets: Local officials, eager to prove their loyalty, reported exaggerated production figures. This led to excessive grain requisitions by the government, leaving insufficient food for the peasants.Poor-Quality Steel Production: The steel produced in backyard furnaces was largely useless, as it was made from scrap metal and lacked the quality needed for industrial use.ConsequencesFamine and Human Toll: The mismanagement of agriculture and resources led to one of the deadliest famines in history, resulting in an estimated 30 to 45 million deaths from starvation and related diseases. Reports of cannibalism and other desperate measures for survival emerged.Economic Devastation: The campaign severely disrupted China’s economy. Traditional farming practices were upended, and many industrial projects failed to yield the expected results. The housing stock was also damaged as materials were taken for collective projects.Political Repercussions: The failure of the Great Leap Forward led to a loss of confidence in Mao’s leadership. He resigned as head of state and went into relative seclusion. The event also strained China’s relations with the Soviet Union, as Soviet aid was withdrawn.The Great Leap Forward was officially halted in 1961, marking a tragic and dark period in China’s history.CopyTry AgainShare",
