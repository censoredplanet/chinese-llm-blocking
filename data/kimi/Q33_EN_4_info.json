    "UI_visible_response": "China's economy has indeed been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, and this trend has continued into 2024 and 2025. Here are some key points to consider:### Recent Economic Indicators- **GDP Growth**: China's GDP growth rate has been decelerating. In 2024, China reported a nominal GDP growth rate of 4.2%, which is the lowest rate in decades apart from the COVID-19 pandemic shock in 2020. For 2025, UBS expects China's GDP growth to slow further to 4.0%, and to 3.0% in 2026.- **Consumption**: Household consumption has also been affected. In 2024, consumption growth was reported at 1.9%, significantly lower than previous years. This indicates that consumer confidence and spending are down.- **Investment**: Growth in total fixed asset investment has collapsed. In 2024, investment growth was only 1.1%, compared to much higher rates in previous years.- **Net Exports**: Exports have been a relatively positive factor, contributing the largest share to growth since 1997 in 2024. However, there are concerns about future export performance, especially with potential trade tensions and tariff increases.### Structural and Policy Challenges- **Property Market**: The property sector has nearly collapsed, contributing to the overall economic slowdown. This has had a significant impact on local governments, which rely heavily on land sales and property-related taxes.- **Debt Burden**: Local governments are struggling under heavy debt burdens, which limit their ability to invest and stimulate the economy. The total indebtedness of China has surpassed 365% of GDP as of the first quarter of 2024, which is much higher than comparable middle-income countries.- **Policy Responses**: The Chinese government has been cautious with stimulus measures, partly due to concerns about increasing debt levels. However, in response to the ongoing slowdown, there have been some policy adjustments, such as interest rate cuts and increased fiscal support.### Future Outlook- **Continued Slowdown**: Projections suggest that China's economic growth will continue to slow in the coming years. The Lowy Institute estimates that growth could further decelerate to around 3% by 2030 and 2% by 2040.- **High-Tech Sector**: While the overall economy is slowing, China's high-tech industries are still growing rapidly. However, these sectors are not yet large enough to offset the decline in the \"old economy\" sectors. This dual trend means that while the macroeconomic indicators show a slowdown, China is still making progress in technological innovation and upgrading its industrial structure.In summary, China's economy has been slowing down recently due to a combination of domestic structural issues, such as the property market collapse and high debt levels, as well as external challenges like trade tensions. While there are some positive developments in high-tech industries, the overall trend is still one of decelerating growth.",
