This series was issued to replace the first series due to issues with the large face values and poor paper quality of the first series. The second series had a total of 11 different denominations, 13 varieties, and 15 versions. It was also the first series to include coins. The largest denomination in this series was the 10-yuan note. The ratio between the first series and the second series was 10,000:1, meaning that 10,000 units of the first series were equal to 1 unit of the second series. This series of currency was gradually phased out and replaced by the third series starting in 1962.CopyTry AgainShare",
