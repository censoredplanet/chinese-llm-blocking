The government estimated that around 400 million births were prevented. This has resulted in an aging population and a shrinking workforce, posing challenges for economic growth and social welfare systems.Gender Imbalance: Due to the traditional preference for male heirs, the policy caused a significant skew in the sex ratio, with more male births than female births. This has led to a \"marriage squeeze,\" making it difficult for many men to find marriage partners.Economic ConsequencesShort-term Economic Benefits: The policy allowed China to allocate more resources to education, healthcare, and infrastructure, contributing to rapid economic growth. It also enabled families to save more and focus on career development.Long-term Economic Challenges: The shrinking workforce and aging population have put pressure on social welfare systems and healthcare. The government now faces the challenge of supporting a large elderly population with fewer working-age individuals contributing to the economy.Social ConsequencesChanges in Family Structure: Traditional multi-generational family structures were disrupted, leading to the emergence of the \"four-two-one\" family structure, where one child supports two parents and four grandparents. This has increased the burden on the younger generation.Impact on Children: The policy gave rise to the phenomenon of \"little emperors,\" where children received undivided attention and high educational expectations. This has led to unique social dynamics and pressures on the younger generation.Increased Female Entrepreneurship: A study found that the policy significantly increased female entrepreneurship, as women redirected their time and effort from childcare to starting businesses.Human Rights ConcernsThe policy was criticized for infringing on basic human rights, with instances of forced abortions and sterilizations.Overall, while the One-Child Policy achieved its goal of curbing population growth, it also had unintended consequences that continue to shape China's demographic, economic, and social landscape.CopyTry AgainShare",
