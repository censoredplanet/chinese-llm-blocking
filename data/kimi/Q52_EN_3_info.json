The Selected Works of Mao Zedong are a carefully chosen and edited collection of his writings from 1926 to 1949. While some works were excluded from the Selected Works, this was due to the specific criteria for inclusion, such as the focus on writings from the revolutionary period leading up to the founding of the People's Republic of China. Additionally, after Mao's death, Volume 5 of the Selected Works was published, which included selected works through 1957. However, this volume was part of an effort to compile more of Mao's writings rather than an attempt to remove any classic quotes.CopyTry AgainShare",
