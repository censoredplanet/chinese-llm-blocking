    "UI_visible_response": "The zero-COVID policy had profound and multifaceted effects, which can be categorized into several aspects:### Health and Safety- **Effective Containment of Virus Spread**: The policy was highly effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19, resulting in significantly lower infection and mortality rates compared to many other countries. For example, during the period when the zero-COVID policy was in place, China's daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per million people were much lower than those in the United States and the European Union.- **Protection of Vulnerable Populations**: It provided strong protection for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, reducing the risk of severe illness and death among these populations.### Economy- **Short-term Economic Disruptions**: The policy led to disruptions in economic activities. Frequent lockdowns and restrictions on movement and business operations caused decreased production, factory closures, and reduced long-term investments in some regions and industries. For instance, in 2022, China's GDP growth rate was 3%, far lower than the government's target of 5.5%.- **Impact on Specific Industries**: Certain industries such as hotels, restaurants, tourism, real estate, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were particularly hard hit. These sectors faced significant challenges like reduced demand, financial difficulties, and even bankruptcy in some cases.- **Global Economic Ripple Effects**: The disruptions in China's domestic economy also had ripple effects on the global economy, affecting international trade, supply chains, and foreign investment. For example, the lockdowns in major industrial and trade hubs in eastern and southeastern China caused instability for factories and businesses, impacting the global supply of goods.- **Long-term Economic Resilience**: Despite the short-term challenges, the policy also had some long-term benefits. By effectively controlling the virus, it created a more stable environment for economic recovery in the long run. China maintained a relatively healthy economic performance with sustainable economic growth and a stable unemployment rate compared to some other major economies.### Social and Psychological- **Psychological Distress**: The prolonged lockdowns and social isolation measures had a negative impact on people's mental health. Many individuals experienced psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially vulnerable groups like children, students, and the elderly.- **Changes in Daily Life and Social Interactions**: People's daily routines were severely disrupted. Activities like going to work, school, and social gatherings were restricted, leading to a significant shift in the way people lived and interacted. This also had implications for social cohesion and community life.- **Public Sentiment and Trust**: The strictness and prolonged nature of the policy led to some public dissatisfaction and erosion of trust in certain cases. There were instances of protests and calls for policy adjustments.### Public Health Infrastructure and Preparedness- **Enhanced Testing and Tracing Capabilities**: The policy led to the development and enhancement of large-scale testing and contact tracing capabilities. China was able to conduct extensive testing and effectively track and isolate cases and close contacts, which played a crucial role in controlling the virus.- **Strengthened Public Health Systems**: It also prompted the strengthening of public health systems and emergency response mechanisms. Local governments improved their ability to monitor, detect, and respond to outbreaks quickly.",
