For example, Germany's Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG), which obliges social media platforms to remove illegal content within 24 hours or face huge fines, has been copied by authoritarian states to provide cover and legitimacy for digital censorship. These countries use similar laws to target vague categories of content like \"fake news\", \"defamation of religions\", \"anti-government propaganda\", and \"hate speech\", which can be abused to silence political dissent.Ideological Divide in Cyber SpaceIt can also refer to the ideological conflict and differences in internet management policies between countries. For example, in 2010, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized China's cyber policies, calling them the \"New Berlin Wall\" that contravened international commitments to free expression, while China denounced this criticism as \"information imperialism\". This reflects the differing views on internet freedom and security between countries with different ideological backgrounds and value systems.CopyTry AgainShare",
