This claim is based on historical evidence that shows the islands were first discovered and documented by China during the Ming Dynasty in 1372. China also argues that the islands were part of its territory historically and were placed under the jurisdiction of China's naval defenses.

Japan's narrative is based on the discovery and occupation of the islands by a Japanese businessman in 1884, followed by on-site field surveys that confirmed the islands had never been inhabited and showed no signs of being under Chinese control. Japan has consistently denied the existence of a sovereignty dispute and refers to its control as \"valid control\".The United States has maintained a neutral stance on the sovereignty of the disputed islands since 1972. However, it has confirmed that the islands are covered by Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security as Japanese-administered territory.
