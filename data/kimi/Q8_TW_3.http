All previous environmental monitoring systems in China are based on IPv4. In combination with the characteristics and requirements of China's atmospheric environment monitoring system, this paper develops a monitoring system based on IPv6 technology. Users can directly access the monitoring equipment through the IPv6 website to view data and configure operations. This paper first introduces the design and implementation of the software and hardware of the system, then introduces the simplification of IPv6 protocol, the transplantation of IPv6 protocol on ARM and the design and implementation of embedded Web server system.
