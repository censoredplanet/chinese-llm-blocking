Here are the respective claims:Japan's ClaimHistorical Discovery and Incorporation: Japan asserts that the Senkaku Islands were uninhabited and showed no trace of being under the control of the Qing Dynasty of China when they were surveyed by Japan from 1885 onwards. Based on these surveys, Japan formally incorporated the islands into its territory in 1895.Administrative Control: The islands have been under Japan's continuous and peaceful administration. After World War II, the islands were placed under the administration of the United States as part of the Nansei Shoto Islands, in accordance with the San Francisco Peace Treaty. They were later reverted to Japan in 1972.International Law: Japan argues that its claim is supported by international law, as there is no evidence of China's effective control or sovereignty over the islands prior to Japan's incorporation.China's ClaimHistorical Discovery and Naming: China claims that the islands were first discovered, named, and utilized by China, with Chinese names appearing in documents from the 15th to 18th centuries. However, Japan disputes the significance of these historical references.Jurisdiction and Maps: China asserts that the islands were under China's jurisdiction as part of its coastal defense area and that ancient maps show the islands as part of China's maritime area. Japan, however, argues that mere appearances on maps and references in documents do not constitute effective control or sovereignty.Taiwan's ClaimTaiwan also claims sovereignty over the islands, referring to them as the Diaoyutai Islands. Taiwan's claim is based on historical and geographical grounds, similar to those of China.U.S. PositionThe United States has historically recognized Japan's administrative control over the islands. However, during the negotiation of the Okinawa Reversion Treaty in 1972, the U.S. adopted a position of neutrality regarding the sovereignty dispute, stating that it passes no judgment on conflicting claims. Despite this, the U.S. has reaffirmed that its defense obligations under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security apply to the Senkaku Islands.CopyTry AgainShare",
