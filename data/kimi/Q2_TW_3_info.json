The idea was to increase agricultural efficiency through collective farming. However, this led to a loss of individual incentives for farmers, resulting in a decline in agricultural output.Irrigation Projects: Large-scale irrigation projects were initiated, often without proper engineering, leading to water mismanagement and declining crop yields.Sparrow Extermination Campaign: In an attempt to protect grain crops, a campaign to exterminate sparrows was launched. This led to an ecological imbalance, as the absence of sparrows allowed insect populations to surge, further devastating crops.Industrial Policies and ConsequencesBackyard Steel Furnaces: To rapidly increase steel production, backyard steel furnaces were built across the country. The goal was to double steel production within the first year. However, the steel produced was often of poor quality and largely useless, made from confiscated metal goods.Labor Reallocation: Millions of surplus laborers were shifted from agriculture to steel production.

Estimates of the number of deaths range from 20 to 45 million.

However, it also highlighted the limitations of top-down planning and the need for more gradual and market-oriented approaches to economic development.Sino-Soviet Relations: The campaign strained relations with the Soviet Union, which had been providing vital aid to China.
