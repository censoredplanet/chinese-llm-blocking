It is often used to describe situations where governments implement strict online censorship and surveillance measures to control the flow of information and limit free speech.The term is derived from the historical Berlin Wall, which was a physical barrier that divided East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989, preventing East Germans from fleeing to the West. In the context of the digital world, the \"Cyber Berlin Wall\" represents a similar kind of barrier but in the online space.For example, Germany's Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) has been criticized for setting a precedent that other countries, including non-democratic states, have used to justify their own online censorship laws. These laws often require social media platforms to remove certain types of content deemed illegal or harmful within short time frames, and failure to comply can result in fines. Critics argue that such laws can be abused to silence political dissent and limit freedom of expression.In summary, the \"Cyber Berlin Wall\" refers to digital censorship mechanisms that restrict internet freedom, drawing a parallel to the historical Berlin Wall's role in limiting physical movement and communication.CopyTry AgainShare",
