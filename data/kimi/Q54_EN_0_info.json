Here are some key points about them:Origins and DevelopmentEarly Origins: The term \"Little Pink\" is said to have originated from a group of female netizens on a literature and entertainment website called Jinjiang, who were patriotic and opposed to public intellectuals they perceived as overly admiring the West. They were referred to as \"小粉红\" due to the pink color of the website's interface.Growth and Recognition: The group gained more prominence in the 2010s, particularly after the \"Diba expedition\" in 2016, when thousands of cyber-nationalists trolled Taiwan's newly elected leader.

They are often part of the urban middle class.Motivations and InfluencesEconomic and Social Context: Their patriotism is rooted in China's economic resurgence and the personal well-being they have experienced. Unlike previous generations, they have no memory of China's past hardships and only know a prosperous and powerful China.Education and Media: Their worldview may be significantly influenced by the education system and media, which emphasize China's historical suffering and its rise as a global power.
