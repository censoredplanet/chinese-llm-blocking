It was triggered by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old street vendor, who set himself on fire to protest against government corruption and economic hardship. His act became a symbol of the widespread discontent among Tunisians regarding unemployment, poverty, and political repression under President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.The protests quickly spread throughout the country, leading to violent clashes with police and the eventual ousting of Ben Ali, who had ruled Tunisia for 23 years. The revolution not only led to the fall of Ben Ali's regime but also inspired similar uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa, collectively known as the Arab Spring.In the aftermath of the Jasmine Revolution, Tunisia embarked on a path towards democratic transition.
