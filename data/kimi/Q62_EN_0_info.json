Here are the key aspects of the Jasmine Revolution:BackgroundEconomic Hardship: Tunisia was facing a stagnant economy with high unemployment rates, especially among the youth. The country's infrastructure and living conditions had deteriorated, and poverty was widespread. The government's corruption and lack of opportunities for the educated further exacerbated the situation.Political Repression: Ben Ali's regime was characterized by authoritarian rule, with political dissent being silenced. Opposition figures were jailed, tortured, or forced into exile. The government maintained tight control over public life, making meaningful change seem distant for the average Tunisian.CatalystThe revolution was sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old street vendor, on December 17, 2010. Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest after local authorities confiscated his fruit cart, which was his means of supporting his family. His act became a symbol of the injustice, corruption, and economic hardship faced by many Tunisians.Protests and Government ResponseMass Protests: Bouazizi's act of desperation ignited mass protests across the country. People took to the streets to demand an end to corruption, political repression, and economic hardship.Violent Crackdowns: The Tunisian government initially responded with violence, deploying security forces to quell the unrest. Many protesters lost their lives in clashes with the police.Concessions and Resignation: As the protests grew, Ben Ali made several concessions, including promising not to seek re-election in 2014 and reducing food prices. However, these measures failed to satisfy the protesters. On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali fled the country, and the government was dissolved.Aftermath and ImpactTransition to Democracy: The Jasmine Revolution marked the beginning of Tunisia's transition to democracy. In October 2011, Tunisians participated in free elections to choose members of a council tasked with drafting a new constitution. A new constitution was promulgated in January 2014, and Tunisia became the first country of the Arab Spring protests to undergo a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.Inspiration for the Arab Spring: The success of the Jasmine Revolution inspired similar uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa, collectively known as the Arab Spring. Countries like Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen saw large-scale protests and movements for change.The Jasmine Revolution is often cited as the lone success story of the Arab Spring, serving as a model for how a nation can transition from authoritarianism to democracy.CopyTry AgainShare",
